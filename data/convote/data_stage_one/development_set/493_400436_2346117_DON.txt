mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from california ( mr. filner ) xz4001330 for offering this amendment and the chairman , the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 for supporting it . 
we know the base bill increases teacher quality requirements , and we also know that we are not doing nearly enough to help head start programs hire and keep these more qualified teachers . 
so i support my colleague 's interests and understanding on making this happen .
