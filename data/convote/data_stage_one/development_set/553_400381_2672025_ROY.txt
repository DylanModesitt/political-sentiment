mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the bipartisan manager 's amendment i am offering today reflects the important contributions of the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003632 . 
it incorporates into the base bill provisions imposing sanctions for the destruction of relevant documents in a pending federal court proceeding , an amendment setting standards for a court 's determination that certain court records should be sealed , and an amendment providing for a presumption on a rule 11 violation when the same issue is repeatedly relitigated . 
this manager 's amendment also makes clear that in the antiforum-shopping provisions , if there is no state court in the county in which the injury occurred , the case can be brought in the nearest adjacent county where a court of general jurisdiction is located . 
finally , the manager 's amendment makes clear that the legislation does not affect personal injury claims that federal bankruptcy law requires to be heard in a federal bankruptcy court . 
this reasonable request was made by the national bankruptcy conference committee on legislation . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan manager 's amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
