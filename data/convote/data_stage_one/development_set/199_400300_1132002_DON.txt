mr. speaker , reserving the right to object , i am trying to stall for time while we clear up a controversy that has arisen . 
i certainly am in support of the intention of the gentleman 's request , but it is my understanding that there may be a problem with one of the amendments . 
i am hoping that by the time i am done filibustering here the gentleman 's staff will have worked it out with the parliamentarian and we will be able to proceed .
