mr. speaker , reclaiming my time . 
i thank the leader for that observation and information . 
i would urge the leader , as we bring additional bills to the floor , that we give the opportunity to have these bills fully considered by the floor . 
we want to move them . 
we want to move them quickly . 
the overwhelming majority of us on both sides of the aisle have voted for all of the bills that you just referenced on the theory , as you said , that we need to move ahead on the pell grants and tanf and on the dollars themselves , on liability issues . 
but the failure to give full consideration to them , assuming full consideration does not mean days and weeks delay but a full day of consideration of these pieces of legislation , we believe is appropriate , particularly if we deal with another very large money bill . 
we hope it goes through committee , and we hope it comes to the floor with an opportunity for members to make suggestions in forms of amendment , either cutting or adding or shifting , as the case may be , those resources . 
because we think that is , you know , the theory of the process is , our collective judgments are better than our individual judgments . 
and that is what democracy is .
