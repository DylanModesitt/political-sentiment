i thank the gentleman for that information . 
now , there is some speculation about an energy bill being considered . 
obviously , gasoline prices are extraordinarily high . 
the american public is very concerned about their energy costs , about the policies of this country . 
do you anticipate an energy bill coming to the floor any time within the next 2 weeks or 3 weeks ?
