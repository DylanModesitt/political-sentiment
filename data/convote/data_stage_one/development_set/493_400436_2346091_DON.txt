mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman from connecticut ( ms. delauro ) xz4001030 for offering this amendment , and the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 for supporting it . 
mr. chairman , helping head start centers develop with college students , students who will then help young children when they are learning to read , certainly will help those children . 
but also it is going to encourage more students at the college level to become and remain head start teachers . 
anything that accomplishes both of these goals is worth doing . 
and i support the amendment .
