mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. kind ) xz4002180 for yielding me this time . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank my friend , mr. kind , for offering this important amendment . 
it is one thing to assess children to understand how best to help them learn . 
but , this administration rushed to test hundreds of thousands of children , and in so doing , used tests that are invalid and unreliable . 
moreover , in its rush , the administration also seems to have virtually no idea how to use this unreliable data . 
had the data been reliable , it would still have been virtually useless . 
this amendment will bring a critically needed scientific perspective to bear on the administration and keep them from implementing this program until they do it right . 
it is an important amendment and i support it .
