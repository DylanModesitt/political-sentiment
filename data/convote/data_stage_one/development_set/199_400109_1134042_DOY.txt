mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
mr. chairman , we have fought over the last few years to reinsert funding for the park service to take care of their uncontrollable costs , and we had a hard time doing that . 
we find out that 1 percent , when it is added up , is $ 261 million . 
that is a very significant hit on these accounts in this important agency . 
i would urge that members support the chairman and we vote this amendment down .
