mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i am going to urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the previous question so that i can amend the rule to allow the house to consider the rangel substitute . 
the substitute was offered in the committee on rules last night , but was blocked on a straight party-line vote . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to print the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the previous question .
