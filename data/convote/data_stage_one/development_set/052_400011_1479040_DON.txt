mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , the fact is this congress took a number of very important actions , as the distinguished gentleman from illinois knows , during that same time period . 
let me ask this : if what the gentleman is saying is that we are not going to do anything , the executive branch has all the control , then how do we not just define madison 's very definition of tyranny ? 
and if that is the case , are we not with this bill promoting tyranny in this country ?
