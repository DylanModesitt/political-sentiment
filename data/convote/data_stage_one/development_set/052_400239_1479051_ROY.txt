mr. chairman , i rise to yield time to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 ; but before doing so , i just want to mention that the previous speaker had a constitutional amendment regarding the issue of continuity in the last congress , and on that constitutional amendment the vote was 63 yeas and 353 nays . 
to say the least , the constitutional approach is difficult . 
mr. chairman , i am glad to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 .
