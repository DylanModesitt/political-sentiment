mr. chairman , i would urge that the point of order be rejected on grounds that the language my friend cites explicates and explains a limitation . 
this is a limitation amendment , and the language in the amendment simply establishes the scope of the limitation . 
the test is not whether the limitation is difficult to figure out . 
the test is whether it imposes a new obligation . 
this language does not , and i would urge rejection of the point of order .
