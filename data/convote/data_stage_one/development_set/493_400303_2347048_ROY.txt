mr. chairman , i do not know how much clearer this can be made . 
we keep having this circular debate on so many issues . 
i will just go back to the law one more time . 
we have mentioned over and over , title vii , civil rights act , 1964 , states specifically , and this is the verbiage , `` this subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any state , or to a religious corporation , association , educational institution , or society , with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation , association , educational institution , or society of its activities. '' there is no way we can change this . 
this is the verbiage . 
this is the language . 
what we are saying here is that a faith-based organization can not be expected to sustain their religious mission if we do not uphold this statute . 
it is very plain . 
if a choir director or a youth director also serves as a head start employee , you certainly should not have to hire somebody that does not sustain the mission of the church .
