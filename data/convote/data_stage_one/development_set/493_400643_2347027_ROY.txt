mr. chairman , i rise in support of the boustany amendment which seeks to include important protections for religious organizations in this bill . 
as i stated in my remarks during consideration of the rule , this nation is second to none in charitable giving and in helping others in need . 
this is not just a religious tenet , but an american principle , and we as americans must continue to encourage and foster that spirit of giving and serving others . 
not allowing those organizations , who have proven they are some of the best at feeding the hungry , healing the sick , and housing the homeless , to provide early childhood education for our children is just wrong . 
a secular group , such as planned parenthood or the sierra club , that receives government money is currently free to hire based on its ideology and mission , but still use federal funds for certain programs and activities they provide . 
yet , groups that are religious in nature are not allowed to hire according to their ideology and mission ? 
because an organization has among its purposes and basic tenets to serve others is not a reason to discriminate against them .
