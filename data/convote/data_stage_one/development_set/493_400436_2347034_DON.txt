mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to read two paragraphs from a letter from barbara pickney , who is head of the st . 
landry parish head start program and is state president of the louisiana head start association . 
paragraph number 1 : `` i have become aware that an amendment has been offered by representative boustany , a republican from louisiana , to the head start bill on the house floor today that would give faith-based organizations providing head start services the right to discriminate with federal funds against employees who are of different faiths . 
as the state president of the louisiana head start association , i strongly oppose such an amendment. '' then she goes on to say , `` i am greatly concerned that the provision to remove civil rights protections for employees could have a negative impact on the children and families who participate in these programs . 
tens of thousands of at-risk 3- and 4-year-old children currently in head start could lose their teachers , who often are the most important adults to whom they have bonded , other than their parents ; not because those teachers are doing a bad job , but because they are the wrong religion. '' that was barbara pickney , st . 
landry parish head start program , state president of the louisiana head start association . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr. edwards ) xz4001180 .
