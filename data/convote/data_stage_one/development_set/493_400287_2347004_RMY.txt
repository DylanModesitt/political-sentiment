mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
first of all , i want to commend the chairman on the good work that he did . 
this bill really increases competition and accountability in the head start early childhood program . 
while the vast majority of head start programs are of very high quality , i have been concerned about recent reports of mismanagement in some of the head start programs . 
that is why i am pleased that h.r. 2123 infuses the head start program with increased competition . 
this amendment i am offering would ensure competition and access to high-quality services for these needy children . 
it would allow a for-profit agency that can demonstrate that it can provide a higher level of services for the same number of head start children at a lower cost , to keep a small portion of the administration 's savings as profit . 
i firmly believe congress should be doing everything possible to encourage the highest-quality providers to become involved in head start . 
i believe my amendment will provide an incentive for high-quality for-profit providers to apply for head start grants and serve our nation 's neediest students . 
i would also like to point out that for-profit entities are already an allowable grantee under current law , as well as h.r. 2123 , so we would not be setting a new precedent in terms of for-profit participation in the program . 
my amendment is bipartisan . 
it is supported by the national child care association and the early care and education consortium . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) , and commend the gentleman for his good work .
