mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentlewoman yielding . 
the membership has been preparing for the debate on this bill with the amendment made in order under the rule . 
the gentlewoman now wants to submit a new amendment . 
i do not think that is fair to the membership who have prepared debate on the bill ; so the answer is no .
