mr. chairman , i thank my friend , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. davis ) xz4000931 , for offering this amendment and the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 for his support . 
approximately two-thirds of head start children are african american or hispanic , but not nearly so many of their teachers are . 
the more diverse our teachers are , the better they will be able to understand the experiences of children in our evermore diverse society , and the better they will be able to help those children learn . 
and the children will also learn better because they will have models that they are missing in their lives right now . 
i want to caution , however , any member that cares about teacher diversity not to vote for the boustany amendment because religious discrimination bears a direct relationship to race and ethnicity . 
it goes hand in hand . 
think about that if you want diversity with your teachers . 
this is an excellent amendment that is provided by the gentleman from illinois ( mr. davis ) xz4000931 and i support it .
