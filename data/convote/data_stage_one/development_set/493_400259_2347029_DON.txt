mr. chairman , today i rise to oppose the boustany amendment and all the explicit discrimination it represents by removing head start hiring protections provided by the equal opportunity act . 
currently , head start law embraces the equal opportunity act . 
this amendment cuts the heart out of it . 
this is a blatant attack on civil rights and this sanctions discrimination . 
this would allow organizations to discriminate based on religion , as well as fundamentally changing disability laws , discrimination paid for by u.s. tax dollars . 
this amendment is offensive to americans who value civil rights , equal justice , and to many , many of us who are strong people of faith . 
let us be clear . 
faith-based organizations currently are providing head start services , and their mission , their work is valued by all of us . 
this amendment provides no additional opportunities to faith-based organizations , because they can currently apply for head start dollars .
