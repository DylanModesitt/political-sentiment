mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
in conclusion , i know we all saw the pictures that were quite shocking in new orleans , and many people were stunned by the level of poverty that we saw when the dikes and the levees broke . 
much more was broken in that community and our communities , and that is , the education of our poorest children . 
no piece of legislation will do more , i think , in advancing the interests and the educational opportunities for our children than this legislation . 
so i thank the gentlewoman from california ( ms. woolsey ) xz4004360 , i thank the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) , the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 , and others involved in moving this important piece of legislation forward , improving the quality and also improving the management , making certain with this amendment that every dollar goes towards the betterment of those disadvantaged in our society . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
