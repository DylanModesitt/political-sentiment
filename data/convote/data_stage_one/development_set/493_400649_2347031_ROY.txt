mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i rise in support of the boustany amendment . 
there has been a lot of talk about how it would appear these faith-based organizations are bigoted and maybe even arrogant for wanting to express their views . 
i think it is the opposite . 
the government here , absent the boustany amendment , is being arrogant and bigoted . 
it could be , if the government wants to take advantage of the location , let us say , of a hebrew school in downtown new york , that it is the best possible route of caring for people in need in that area . 
why would the government think that it is our position , our prerogative , to insist that the hebrew school hire somebody outside their faith tradition ? 
it is the ultimate of arrogance on the part of the federal government . 
and to those who are concerned about the constitutional issues , may i remind my colleagues the supreme court actually ruled on this matter . 
in a 1987 case , corporation of the presiding bishop v. amos , the court supported this kind of approach .
