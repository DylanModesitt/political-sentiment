reclaiming my time , i know the leader understands those were largely rhetorical questions . 
the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 , however , does express a view that a bill that can be very helpful to us that came out 65 to 5 , overwhelming agreement , came out months ago . 
we do hope that this bill can be brought to the floor , certainly before , hopefully if not the end of next week , the week following . 
because we believe it is the kind of legislation that people would be proud of . 
democrats and republicans came together , worked on it , came out with a bill , and it is a very good bill .
