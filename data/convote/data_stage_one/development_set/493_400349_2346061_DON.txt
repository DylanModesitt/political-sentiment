mr. chairman , for almost 40 years , head start has assisted low-income preschool children and their families . 
it has been an invaluable resource to many children and families across our country . 
i am pleased to rise to join with my colleagues about the future of head start . 
as congressman and a former county executive , education is one of my top priorities . 
in particular , head start programs are essential to so many children 's futures , for research shows that early learning is a fundamental piece of a child 's education . 
i have long held a firm belief in the importance of education and have often spoke of our nation 's need to ensure that , even at the earliest stages our children have access to programs and services that will enrich their education and lives . 
last year , head start helped 912 , 000 three , four , and five year olds build a solid foundation so they are ready to tackle reading and math in kindergarten . 
head start allows children to be ready to succeed in school and in life . 
giving them that extra boost that they need will allow them to be productive citizens . 
head start also provides the youngsters and their families with a comprehensive list of support services -- from health screenings to nutritional advice to parent counseling . 
i stand behind this program because i have seen first hand how head start helps the entire family grow and succeed together . 
head start is a good start for america 's future .
