mr. chairman , i want to thank my friend and colleague from california ( ms. millender-mcdonald ) xz4002750 for offering this amendment and our chairman for accepting it . 
head start is a program to give a helping hand to vulnerable children , and no child is more vulnerable than a homeless or foster child . 
this amendment will improve outreach and coordination of services for these very children , and this will help ensure that they receive the services they need to succeed in school and in life . 
mr. chairman , this is a worthy amendment and i support it . 
ms. millender-mcdonald .
