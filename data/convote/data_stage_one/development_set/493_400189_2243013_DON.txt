i thank the gentleman . 
the gse , the gse bill was initially , our thought was that would be on the floor this coming week . 
the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 , the ranking democrat on the committee on financial services , is on the floor and has been very involved in this bill . 
i am not sure you even know this , but the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 informs me that there are very significant sums that would be available to the gulf area for housing in the gse bill , which will be regular order , and the benefit would be that this money would be available , and we know we are going to have to spend money in that area . 
can you tell me why the gse bill is not on the floor ? 
this deals , as you know , with fannie mae and freddie mac .
