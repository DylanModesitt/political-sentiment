mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
what we tried to do in the committee bill is to make sure that there was a clear line of accountability on some of these fiscal matters . 
we struggled long and hard on this committee with the question of fiscal management and mismanagement of a number of these programs . 
while the vast majority of head start programs are well-run programs that provide excellent services , the services that we have come to expect from those programs on behalf of these children in head start , we have had some problems . 
this is not about reducing the parents ' role . 
it is about increasing the accountability , increasing the accountability of this board , so they will understand the gravity of the situation , which they have . 
we have also strengthened the parent policy council to be involved in all aspects of program authorization , and we require that the board act on those priorities . 
whether they agree or disagree , they must act on it . 
the fact of the matter is , i think many , many people involved in head start believe that this is a very substantial improvement that will avoid the kinds of problems that we have seen in the past that have drained resources from this agency , taken away from the services provided to these children . 
parents have been an integral part of this program from the beginning , they continue to be , and , in fact , their position is strengthened in this legislation . 
but we must deal in a forthright manner with this question of fiscal accountability , and we are making those boards more accountable in this legislation ; and i hope that we would reject the souder amendment .
