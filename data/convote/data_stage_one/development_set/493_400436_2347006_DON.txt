mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to the musgrave amendment . 
the underlying bill requires that head start grantees keep their administrative expenses to 15 percent or less of the grant . 
the grantee that keeps expenses lower than 15 percent would have the remaining funds available for teacher salaries or more books or other improvements that benefit the children . 
that is , unless this amendment passes and the grantee is a for-profit organization , in which case under my colleague 's amendment , the difference between the 15 percent and lower expenses simply would be in the pocket of the for-profit organization . 
so my colleague 's amendment comes down to this , very simply : whether we want the benefits of more efficient administration of grantees to go to the children or whether we want to give the businesses an incentive to cut corners for profits . 
i hope members all remember hmos ; those profits do not go directly back into the program to benefit the children . 
i think the answer is obvious , particularly when we are serving fewer than half the eligible children . 
i only hope that the majority will be as willing to spend federal dollars on serving the children as they would be in giving those dollars to for-profit companies . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , our ranking member .
