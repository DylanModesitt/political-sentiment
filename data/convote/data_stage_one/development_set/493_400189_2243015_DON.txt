mr. speaker , if the gentlemen from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 does not object , let me yield to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 , the ranking member , because i know he has worked very hard with the gentleman from ohio ( mr. oxley ) xz4003070 , as you well know , in a very bipartisan way . 
you mentioned 63 to 5 , 65 to 5 ; and so we did not perceive there to be much opposition to the bill .
