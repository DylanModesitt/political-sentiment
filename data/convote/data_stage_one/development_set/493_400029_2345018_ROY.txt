mr. speaker , once again i share the frustration and understand the gentlewoman from california , as to her amendment not being made in order here . 
but i once again would point out that the amendment was presented in the committee and was rejected by the committee . 
and once again , it is not necessary to replow old ground every time the bill appears before the group again . 
so i appreciate that consideration very much . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
