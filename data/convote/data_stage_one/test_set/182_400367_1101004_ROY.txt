mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to say that it makes me so proud to hear the gentlewoman from new york talk with glowing admiration not only about how important this homeland security bill is but about the hard work that went into it and how it became a part of a better product . 
yesterday , the committee on rules had an opportunity , virtually all day , to hear testimony from members across the aisle talk about ideas and thoughts and suggestions that they had that would make this a better bill . 
the chairman , the gentleman from california , not only listened to them but he worked with the chairman of the committee on homeland security , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , on perfecting this bill by adding in amendments . 
as i mentioned earlier , mr. speaker , there are a large number of amendments that were added to this , perfecting the bill , perfecting the process , but more importantly giving an opportunity for members of this body to make sure , from their own perspective , that homeland security became more effective by providing the information that was needed to address their local communities . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , the chairman of the committee on rules .
