mr. chairman , further reserving the right to object , i appreciate the gentleman 's explanation . 
the underlying amendment makes unnecessary disclosure of very sensitive information . 
it is burdensome upon each of the departments that it requires this disclosure to be brought forward , and as a matter of fact , the explanation that the gentleman just gave saying that makes it only available to hpsci and ssci , the two intelligence committees , does not include the committee on armed services , which has great responsibility for military defense intelligence . 
so i do object , mr. chairman .
