mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , as i indicated earlier , the berman amendment would potentially undermine the intelligence community 's ability in the current form to collect information on terrorists by tipping the terrorists off to our sources and methods . 
the amendment would require disclosure of data mining sources and methods used to collect information on terrorists and contains no exemption for national security purposes . 
the house has worked to increase the use of open source and other information against foreign terrorists and others who seek to harm the united states . 
the amendment applies onerous reporting requirements that could dramatically restrict the use of such technologies to use such resources to discover and respond to terrorist activities . 
finally , it would divert scarce government resources away from the most critical fight that we have today , the fight against terror . 
join me , the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 , the gentleman from ( mr. oxley ) xz4003070 , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. tom davis ) , and the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 in opposing this amendment ; not the direction the amendment wants to go , but in the way this amendment is crafted at this time and in this bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
