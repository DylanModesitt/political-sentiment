mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule . 
as a ranking member of the committee on homeland security , i strongly believe this base bill is deficient in a number of significant areas . 
this 79-page bill fails to address a number of critical aspects of homeland security and does not deliver on the homeland security commitments made in the 9/11 act . 
that is why i , like many of my colleagues in the house , felt compelled to submit amendments to the committee on rules for this bill . 
all told , there were 85 amendments offered , many of them from my colleagues on the committee on homeland security . 
the rule before us today will allow 24 amendments to be considered by the full house . 
that is simply wrong . 
the rule blocks a meaningful debate on important amendments like the one the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. lowey ) xz4002460 offered to close a major aviation security gap . 
it would have required airport workers to be physically screened before accessing planes in restricted areas of airports . 
the rule also denies consideration of an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from california , this rule also prevents the gentlewoman from the district of columbia ( ms. norton ) xz4002950 from presenting her amendment to close gaps in the public transit and rail system . 
it also denies the house the opportunity to consider amendments offered by the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 to improve chemical plant security , develop policies for rerouting hazardous material , and grant dhs whistleblower protections . 
mr. speaker , i could go on and on listing good amendments that were done so wrong by this rule . 
but instead , i will close by urging a no vote on this rule .
