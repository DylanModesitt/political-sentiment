madam speaker , i support our action today to reauthorize the usa patriot act . 
within weeks after the horrendous terrorist attacks of 2001 , congress responded with the patriot act , providing our law enforcement and intelligence communities with much-needed tools to track down terrorists , sever their communications and funding networks , and prevent future attacks on our citizens . 
as chairman of the house financial services committee , i was proud to help write the antiterrorist financing provisions of this act . 
millions of dollars in terrorist assets have been frozen or seized since 9/11 . 
we have broken up suspected terrorist financing networks , including one in my home state of ohio . 
the terrorist financing tools included in the act were further supplemented by the intelligence reform legislation approved in the wake of the 9/11 commission 's report . 
as a former special agent of the fbi , i know that other sections of the patriot act have proven just as vital in assisting law enforcement combat the new threat of international terrorism . 
i am pleased that this reauthorization makes permanent all but a few of the act 's expiring provisions , but regret that the 4-year sunset for the remaining authorities was made a part of this final product . 
including any sunset sends the wrong signal to our law enforcement agencies , indicating that our trust in them is incomplete at a time when their services have helped prevent further terrorist attacks . 
they should have our full support and every reasonable tool we can give them to help fight the global war on terror . 
one of the provisions still subject to a sunset deals with the use of roving wiretaps . 
as one of the few members of congress who has conducted undercover surveillance , i can tell you now that the need for roving wiretap authority will not expire in 7 years . 
tying intercept authority to an individual suspect rather than a particular communication device is simply common sense in this era of throwaway cell phones and e-mail . 
further , there is absolutely no evidence that wiretap authority or any other usa patriot act provision has been used to violate the civil liberties of americans . 
congress recognizes the delicate balance between deterring terrorist activities and preserving the freedoms we hold so dear . 
i know beyond a doubt that terrorists make no such distinction . 
the patriot act has been a success , and we as a nation are safer for it . 
its provisions are helping to put the fbi and cia on a more equal footing with terrorists , who use every available technology to plot with impunity . 
the act refines our surveillance laws for the high-technology era -- something that has been long overdue . 
i support the reauthorization of the usa patriot act , and hope that congress will work toward making the roving wiretap and other temporary provisions permanent .
