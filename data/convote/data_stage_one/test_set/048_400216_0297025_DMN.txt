mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , current law requires that services be provided to both in-school youth and out-of-school youth . 
nothing in the act prevents states from spending all of youth funds on out-of-school youths . 
in fact , as many as 17 states spend more than 30 percent on out-of-school programs . 
the majority of states are challenged by current out-of-school requirements . 
eliminating services for in-school youth cuts funding for programs designed to keep youths in school , to develop workforce skills , to prepare for post-secondary education , and provide after school and summer opportunities . 
h.r. 27 limits the business community 's ability to work with schools and prepare emerging workforces . 
in many communities , you have that cooperation between the business community and the schools . 
h.r. 27 restricts services for rural youths . 
many rural in-school programs provide workforce development and on-school support service for students who are at risk for dropping out . 
i think it is very , very important that we maintain the in-school youth program , and that is the purpose for me offering this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
