mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act , h.r. 810 , legislation that will dramatically expand the number of stem cell lines available for federally funded research . 
this bill will allow scientists to more effectively pursue cures and therapies for a wide array of life-threatening illnesses and disabilities affecting millions of americans . 
earlier today , the house passed a related but very different bill : the stem cell therapeutic and research act , h.r. 2520 . 
this legislation will create a new federal program to collect and store umbilical-cord-blood stem cells for research purposes . 
i support the additional research on adult stem cells provided for by h.r. 2250 , but this legislation is not a substitute for h.r. 810 and its emphasis on embryonic stem cell research . 
embryonic stem cells have a unique ability to develop into any type of cell as they mature , offering scientists tremendous insights on the replacement of damaged cells and organs , the mechanics of life-threatening diseases , and the testing and development of new drugs . 
adult stem cells , on the other hand , have not shown this ability to differentiate into specific types of cells , have not yet been identified in all vital organs , and are difficult to identify , purify , and grow . 
although embryonic stem cell research promises extraordinary medical discoveries , the available supply of existing embryonic stem cells is woefully insufficient . 
according to the national institutes of health , nih , only 22 of the 78 stem cell lines that were deemed eligible for federal funding by president george bush in 2001 are currently available to nih investigators . 
some of these 22 lines are too expensive or difficult to obtain , and some have been contaminated with non-human molecules diminishing their therapeutic value for humans . 
to make matters worse , these stem cell lines lack the genetic variation needed to develop therapies that will benefit the diverse population of the united states . 
h.r. 810 addresses the shortage of embryonic stem cell lines by lifting the arbitrary and indefensible august 9 , 2001 cut-off date for stem cell eligibility . 
since 2001 , 128 embryonic stem cell lines have been developed , including disease-specific stem cell lines that allow researchers to understand the basic cause of some rare diseases . 
this legislation also provides stricter ethical guidelines to ensure that only the best and most ethical stem cell research will be federally funded . 
the state of california has already taken steps to ensure that human embryonic stem cell research will be allowed to develop by establishing the institute for regenerative medicine , which will devote $ 3 billion to california universities and research institutions over the next 10 years . 
the passage of h.r. 810 will further empower and equip california scientific institutions to undertake cutting-edge research on the most pressing medical challenges of our day . 
let us make no mistake , the development of lifesaving medical procedures has been slowed by an unwarranted restriction on stem cell research . 
i believe that , as policymakers , we have a moral imperative to pursue innovative medical research that can improve the quality of life and prevent harmful illnesses and diseases for generations to come . 
i urge my colleagues to join the innumerable scientists , university leaders , patient groups , and medical research groups that support h.r. 810 .
