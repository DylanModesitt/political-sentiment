mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
mr. speaker , the resolution before us represents a promise , a promise by the house of representatives to the american people that not only are we aware of the hindrances to prosperity now existing in the national economy but that we are committed to removing them as soon as possible . 
we are aware that compliance with federal regulation costs american companies $ 850 billion a year . 
we are aware those costs are passed along from american businesses to american consumers in higher prices to the tune of $ 8 , 000 per family per year . 
we are aware that exports account for one-sixth of our economic growth , and that one in five american factory jobs and one in three american crop acres depend on customers in foreign markets and that many markets are still closed to our goods . 
we are aware that 1 million american jobs rely on research and development conducted by private businesses and through our world-class university system . 
we are aware that 60 percent of american businesses are impeded in their growth by the lack of advanced training in the workplace . 
we are also aware that health care is too expensive , coverage too limited , and that small businesses are at a disadvantage in covering their employees . 
we are aware that our tax system is unfair and inefficient , and that it costs families and businesses billions of dollars and hours every year . 
we are aware that our economy is dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil , and that it is overrun with frivolous lawsuits that abuse our legal system . 
and , starting this week , mr. speaker , the house is going to do something about it . 
we are going to take up major legislation addressing these eight sources of economic friction and tear down these eight walls now surrounding the american dream . 
the debate about these eight issues : trade freedom and fairness ; bureaucratic red tape ; innovation and investment ; health care security ; lifelong learning ; tax relief and simplification ; lawsuit abuse reform ; and energy independence are over . 
we all know these impediments to prosperity need reform , and we know what we have to do to reform them . 
with this resolution , mr. speaker , the house will take a first step toward enacting these needed economic reforms to help small businesses create not just jobs but long-term , rewarding careers for the american people .
