mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to assure the gentlewoman from california that her concerns on electronic data and the fact that in an era of voip that we do have to look at that . 
i serve with the gentlewoman in california on many of the caucuses that deal with that . 
i look forward to both in judiciary and , quite candidly , in other committees of jurisdiction here in the congress to continue to work on properly identifying and modernizing how that is going to be interpreted . 
i think it is beyond the scope of the patriot act today , but it certainly is not beyond the congress to have to bring things up to snuff , and i look forward to working with the gentlewoman from california . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
