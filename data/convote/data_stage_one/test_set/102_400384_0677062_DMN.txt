mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to s. 256 , legislation that will make it harder for individuals to eliminate their debts after liquidating most of their assets by filing bankruptcy . 
thousands of women and their children are affected by the bankruptcy system each year . 
this bill will only inflict additional hardship on over a million economically vulnerable women and their families . 
in fact , women are the fastest growing group to file for bankruptcy . 
more than 1 million women will find themselves in bankruptcy court this year , outnumbering men by about 150 , 000 . 
women who lose a job , have a medical emergency , or go through divorce make up more than 90 percent of the women who file for bankruptcy . 
this legislation 's means test provision would require even the poorest filers -- struggling single mothers , elderly women who are victims of scam artists -- to meet complicated filing requirements to access the bankruptcy system . 
in addition , the bill would make it much harder for women to collect child support payments from men who file for bankruptcy because the bill gives credit card companies , finance companies , auto lenders and other commercial creditors rights to a greater share of the debtor 's income during and after bankruptcy . 
this bill pulls the rug out from under economically vulnerable women and children . 
it increases the rights of creditors while making it harder for single parents and others facing financial crises . 
this harsh bankruptcy reform legislation will not help those families that are struggling to get by . 
this bill will do nothing to reduce the number of bankruptcy filings or address the problem of record-high consumer debt . 
it is a gift to the credit card and banking industries ; but one that will be paid for by those least able to afford it . 
instead of giving a handout to credit card companies , we should ensure that americans losing their jobs or struggling with medical debt have a second chance for economic security . 
that is what our bankruptcy laws are intended to provide . 
this bill is terrible for consumers , working families and women , and i urge my colleagues to vote against it .
