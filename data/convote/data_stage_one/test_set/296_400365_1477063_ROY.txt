mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , the major argument that we have heard against the base amendment and in favor of the watt substitute is that if we do not pass the watt substitute , we will be amending the bill of rights for the first time in the history of this country . 
that is not true . 
in the dred scott decision , chief justice taney claimed that the fifth amendment 's due process clause , which he interpreted to include a substantive right to the protection of property , prohibited restrictions on slave ownership . 
the three amendments that were passed during the civil war , the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments , corrected that gross constitutional misinterpretation and it slammed the door shut so tightly that that issue never has been raised again ; and our country has been much , much better for it . 
in a similar manner , house joint resolution 10 seeks to correct two supreme court precedents that repudiated 2 centuries of jurisprudence . 
the time to correct those two precedents is today . 
we must vote against the watt substitute amendment which guts the thrust of house joint resolution 10 and then pass house joint resolution 10 by a two-thirds majority to send it to the other body . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
