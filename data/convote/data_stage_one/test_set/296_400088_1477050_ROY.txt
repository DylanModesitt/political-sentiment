mr. speaker , i stand before you today in strong and wavering support of the flag protection amendment . 
i 'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this important measure . 
our flag is more than just a piece of cloth . 
from lexington to gettysburg to falluja , more than a million brave americans have given their lives in defense of our flag and the american ideals it represents . 
we must honor their ultimate sacrifice , and the sacrifices made by the almost 60 , 000 veterans in my home state of wyoming , by defending our flag with the courage and resolve they proved possible . 
the flag protection amendment will protect from desecration the most widely recognized symbol of freedom and democracy worldwide , one that offers hope and comfort to the students and teachers , lawmakers , and military men and women who pledge allegiance to the flag every day across the nation . 
with that , i strongly urge final passage of the flag protection amendment .
