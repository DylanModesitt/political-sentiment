mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i would say in closing this has been considered in the past . 
it has passed . 
it passed on a voice vote last october . 
i think in view of what is happening to the mass transit systems around the world , we have heard a lot of hue and cry about helping to protect our mass transit systems in this country . 
and i think by making standard criminal penalties , we are going a step in the right direction to use these penalties as a deterrence to terrorism on our mass transit and rail systems . 
i urge passage of the amendment .
