mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection action . 
the title of this bill is a misnomer . 
it should be titled the `` corporate protection and improved profitability act '' . 
if passed , this act will be a boon for credit card and financial lending institutions and a nightmare for american families who are struggling to stay strong in an economically depressed society . 
essentially , the house is contemplating legislation that is more punitive to individuals seeking bankruptcy protection than corporations that resort to filing for bankruptcy . 
i also have concerns about house procedures for s. 256 . 
a closed rule was employed , resulting in thirty-five democratic amendments being rejected from consideration . 
debate on an amendment to the bill was prevented . 
thirty-five amendments were submitted before the rules committee and not one was accepted . 
not only were members of the house prevented from engaging in debate but also the american people have been denied the opportunity to hear legitimate debate regarding this act we are considering today . 
i am especially distressed about the majority 's refusal to accept amendments that related to identify theft and exemptions for disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurs after active duty . 
my review of s. 256 compels me to conclude that the framers of the bill failed or refused to recognize that recent economic policies by the current administration have directly contributed to the proliferation of bankruptcy filings by consumers . 
burgeoning deficits , perpetual and high unemployment , and the exportation of jobs overseas are just a few of the by-products of failed and poorly conceived government policies that have contributed and continue to contribute to the need for individuals to seek bankruptcy protection . 
i also oppose s. 256 because it does absolutely nothing to stem the predatory practices employed by credit card companies , or the abusive fees and penalties imposed on individuals who make just one late payment . 
further , the wealthiest citizens in our country are able to insulate their assets by placing them in trusts that are protected in bankruptcy proceedings . 
i staunchly oppose s. 256 . 
democrats were denied the opportunity to offer amendments , the american people have been denied a full opportunity to determine the full implications of the changes in bankruptcy law , and the act is fundamentally anticonsumer . 
mr. speaker , my conscience dictates that i oppose s. 256 . 
i encourage my house colleague to vote no on the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act . 
mrs. davis california . 
mr. speaker , i rise to voice my opposition to the bankruptcy reform legislation before us today . 
unfortunately , there are individuals who abuse the credit system and use it for their own gain . 
this is wrong and we should be working to stop those who take advantage of the bankruptcy laws . 
however , i worry s. 256 will hurt the thousands of americans who have absolutely no choice but to file bankruptcy as a last resort . 
specifically , i am concerned about the impact on our brave service members and our military families . 
the numerous activations and extended tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan are causing our military families to face debt and serious financial strain . 
studies show that the incomes of military , families decrease significantly when the service member is deployed . 
four out of 10 reservists , for example , take a drop in pay once they are deployed overseas . 
i have met with military families in san diego who are facing the realities and the financial strain that come with activation . 
i worry about the military spouse whose husband is activated to serve in iraq for a year and must leave his job or his business . 
somehow , we expect the spouse to care her children , to make the house payment , and to pay the bills on an income that is significantly lower . 
some military families will have no choice but to file for bankruptcy because of the environment we have created for them . 
the bankruptcy reform bill before us today does not address the needs of our military families and the realities they are facing . 
s. 256 will make it harder for military families to recover from a bankruptcy because of the additional costs and the stricter requirements . 
the senate did include provisions exempting military personnel serving in combat from certain provisions of the bill . 
but , unfortunately , the financial impact of an extended deployment could remain long after the service member returns home to his family . 
s. 256 does not recognize this reality and does not consider the difficult circumstances facing military families today . 
i am against passing legislation only adding to the enormous burden we are already placing on those defending the united states and the families sending a loved one into harm 's way . 
i urge my colleagues to vote against the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act .
