mr. speaker , today , i rise in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , proposing an amendment to the constitution of the united states authorizing congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states . 
since 1990 , i have voted in opposition to a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration or flag burning . 
i find flag desecration disgraceful , and i get as angry as anyone does when i see or hear about such things . 
but , i do not believe we should amend the u.s. constitution to deal with this matter . 
not once during the 15 years i have voted on this amendment to the constitution has a crisis occurred with people burning flags . 
as a combat veteran of the vietnam war , i know well the sacrifices that have been made by many generations of americans to protect our freedom . 
we , as americans , should honor our flag . 
it is a symbol of our freedom . 
i am immensely gratified when i see all the flags flying in the face of terrorist attacks and in support of our troops fighting overseas . 
they make me very proud . 
however , i am not at all comfortable with changing the bill of rights that guarantees our freedoms . 
the bill of rights guarantees freedom of expression including dissent . 
individual freedom and opportunity have built our nation into the strongest on earth where liberties are enshrined in our constitution . 
the first amendment to the constitution protects free speech and allows us to openly debate any issue in this country . 
as vile as flag desecration may be , the supreme court has ruled that it is political speech and , therefore , protected under the first amendment . 
i remain committed to preserving freedom and opportunity . 
in the true spirit of america , freedom must be maintained for those with whom we agree and , yes , those with whom we disagree . 
i believe we , as individuals , should honor the flag as a symbol of that freedom . 
applying government coercion to prevent flag desecration actually chips away at that freedom of expression . 
old glory can withstand a few exhibitionists looking for attention . 
we do n't have to jeopardize our freedoms to protect it . 
it is a symbol of what protects us .
