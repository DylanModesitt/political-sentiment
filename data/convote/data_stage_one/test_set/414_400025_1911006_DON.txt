mr. chairman , i yield myself 2 minutes . 
mr. chairman , i have indicated to the body what my intention was , and it will be my intention and one to be part of the legislative history that we will ensure that , before this bill becomes law , information about sources and methods go just where they have always gone . 
the committee on armed services does not get this information . 
only the permanent select committee on intelligence gets this information . 
the gentleman was wrong in his characterization . 
secondly , this imposes absolutely no burden on any other agency of government other than the attorney general and the justice department . 
it lays out information that the attorney general should seek from other agencies . 
it imposes no obligation on those agencies to respond . 
it does not encumber any sources or funds they do not want to spend , and it simply asks the attorney general to then compile whatever information those agencies have chosen to provide to the attorney general into a report which will be sent public in the case of information which is not sensitive and classified in an annex classified where it does involve such information . 
there is not one word in this bill that imposes a single mandate on any other federal agency . 
the only obligation on the attorney general is to seek this information from the other agencies . 
there are no sanctions . 
there are no mandates . 
there is no compulsion . 
the reason , i would suggest to this body , that we will hear some people raising concerns is because the justice department has misrepresented the obligations of both it and other agencies under this amendment . 
the need for this amendment is that we have wasted millions and millions of dollars on implementing database-mining activities which , when they became public , produced such an outrage they were canceled . 
we are trying to get an early start , show the people that these efforts are protected , that they are targeted at sensitive information . 
we could have introduced a bill or offered an amendment to ban data mining . 
we did not do that . 
there is legislation to do that . 
we do not want to tie the hands of our security agencies in gathering this information . 
we simply want to provide a logical mechanism to gather the information so that the american people can feel more comfortable that what is being done is protected . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
