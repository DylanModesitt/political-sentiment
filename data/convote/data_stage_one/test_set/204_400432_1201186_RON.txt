mr. speaker , i oppose this bill and support the president 's position on embryonic stem cells . 
let 's be clear . 
embryonic stem cell research is legal in america today , and nothing in the administration 's current policy has affected the legality of this research . 
the administration 's policy simply provides that federal taxpayer dollars not be used to destroy human embryos . 
i believe most americans , when they understand this , agree with the administration . 
but this rule does not in any way limit the private sector from pursuing embryonic stem cell research . 
but ultimately , mr. speaker , no one can deny that this debate involves profound ethical and moral questions . 
this is a matter of conscience for millions of americans who are deeply troubled by the idea of their own funds being used to destroy another human life . 
for many of my colleagues , and for me , this is a vote of conscience . 
let the private sector go forward , if it must , with the destruction of embryos for ethically questionable science . 
but spend the people 's money on proven blood cord , bone marrow and adult stem cell research .
