mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i want to join with the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence in opposing this amendment and just making the point that sources and methods are important . 
his analysis and the analysis of his experts and ours is that this would indeed compromise those capabilities . 
i think it is a real mistake to pass this amendment . 
i would hope the house votes it down .
