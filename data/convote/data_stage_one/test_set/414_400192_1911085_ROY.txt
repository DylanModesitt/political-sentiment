mr. chairman , i yield myself 4 minutes , and i am very pleased to offer an amendment to the usa patriot reauthorization act which deals with the new reality of overlapping links between illicit narcotics and global terrorism . 
evidence of this deadly and emerging symbiotic relationship is overwhelming . 
my amendment creates a new crime that will address and punish those who would use these illicit narcotics to promote and support terrorism . 
the committee on international relations recently held a hearing on afghanistan in which our well-informed drug enforcement administration conservatively estimated that nearly half of the formerly designated foreign terrorist organizations have links to illicit narcotics . 
it has been widely reported that the madrid train terrorist bombings were partially financed by hashish money . 
in colombia , the revolutionary armed forces of colombia and the auc , which are two of these ftos , thrive on the drug trade , supporting and sustaining themselves with illicit proceeds . 
my amendment , recognizing this new and deadly reality , makes it a federal crime under the controlled substance import and export act to engage in drug trafficking that directly or indirectly aids or provides support , resources , or any pecuniary value to a foreign terrorist organization or any person or group planning , preparing for , or carrying out a terrorist offense . 
the amendment provides very tough penalties , consistent with the serious nature of this crime . 
as provided in my amendment , it will no longer be necessary for our overworked dea and other law enforcement agencies abroad to be looking for a u.s. nexus to illicit drug shipments and drug traffickers who are engaging in this deadly trade which supports global terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i urge adoption of my amendment which will give the tools to our law enforcement personnel in their ongoing global fight against terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
