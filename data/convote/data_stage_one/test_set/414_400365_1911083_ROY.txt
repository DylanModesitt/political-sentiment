reserving the right to object , let me say that i will not object , because i think this modification is a significant improvement to the original amendment . 
i realize that this amendment must be further honed , and i pledge to the gentlewoman from texas my cooperation to attempt to do that in conference . 
mr. chairman , i withdraw my reservation of objection .
