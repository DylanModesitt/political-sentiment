mr. speaker , true patriots need not hide behind the flag nor apply phony titles to cover the misguided purposes of their legislation . 
from its origin , this grossly misnamed patriot act has cloaked its weaknesses by implying that its opponents are `` un-patriots '' as in `` unpatriotic. '' this is all part of a troubling pattern : secret prisons , sneak and peek searches , gag orders , redefining torture to exclude cruel and degrading punishment , extraordinary rendition , combing through library records , and even attempting to misuse our military to spy on religious groups . 
these acts debase our american values . 
this bill should be rejected because it fails to strike the proper balance between the security we demand and the liberties that we cherish . 
yes , vice president cheney has suddenly emerged from his secure , undisclosed location and taken pause from his campaign to preserve torture in order to enthusiastically embrace today 's bill . 
but intrusive , invasive powers in the hands of a few with little oversight and no accountability is a formula for wrongdoing . 
we should not surrender our liberties to any administration . 
retreating to such abusive tactics is weakness , not strength . 
we should not add even more powers to an administration that has so often been willing to abuse its existing power , nor should we add more authority to an administration that has acted in authoritarian ways . 
real patriots understand that an all-powerful government can undermine our security just as surely as a dangerous religious fanatic . 
and all of this is occurring when the bipartisan 9/11 commission , the citizens ' commission that this administration fought every step of the way , is giving the administration and this republican congress one f after another for not protecting our families . 
instead , we get this kind of legislation . 
mr. speaker , authoritarianism is not born full-bodied . 
it is conceived in small injustices , which tolerated over time become irreversible . 
benjamin franklin understood when he said , `` those who would give up essential liberty , to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety. '' this much is certain , each day of this administration brings more news of both deaths of true patriots abroad and more abuses of our values by those who claim to be patriots at home . 
this is an administration where the ends always seem to justify the means . 
but their `` ends '' too often betray our safety , and their `` means '' forsake our values . 
to those who promote this misguided act , pull down your false colors ; raise the american flag of freedom . 
reject this bill .
