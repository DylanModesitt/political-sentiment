mr. speaker , i rise in support of the legislation to help us have continued success in the funding for research for uses for adult stem cells . 
adult stem cells really encompass a number of different kinds . 
people have talked today about cord blood . 
they have talked about the bone marrow stem cells . 
a number of them have already been used clinically and with much success . 
i believe it is this congress 's duty to help support that , because certainly we will have many people who have benefited already and additional people in the future who can benefit from this kind of research . 
in fact , the university of pittsburgh in my hometown just announced about a week or so ago that they are doing clinical trials regarding the use of bone marrow stem cells to help reverse chronic heart failure . 
i met a gentleman actually who was involved in the research , and they talked about trials that have already been done in south america that have been successful . 
these are all with adult stem cells . 
it is important for congress to fund research , but it is especially important for this congress to fund responsible research and that is the research supported on this bill on adult stem cells .
