mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
in closing , my friends on the other side have had numerous objections to provisions in h.r. 27 . 
they have a right to do so and i expect it will be warmly discussed in the ensuing discussion of the bill itself . 
i believe strongly in the ability of our states , governors , local boards , workforce boards , to be creative and innovative . 
there is no omniscient power that we have here . 
people can think for themselves in other parts of this country . 
and the essence of our government demands that we give them the opportunity to succeed without the benevolent help of the federal government . 
our job , might i remind my colleagues , is to make sure the micaelas of the world never slip through the cracks . 
i believe , and i have confidence in the ability of local governments to be creative and effective , and i think so does h.r. 27 . 
what we have today is a confusing patchwork of employment , training services . 
the duplication of those reduces the amount of money we get to use to help micaelas . 
many amendments that we will be discussing on the floor have also been discussed in committee . 
a lot of other amendments were heard in the committee . 
this was fully discussed in committee and voted upon . 
may i just , in closing , ask us not to lose sight that the goal is service and how to provide training for people which is given without any precondition . 
hiring practices that are protected by existing law are that , protected by existing law . 
if we feel there is a problem with that , then we should attack the existing law , and there are venues to do that . 
this is not the venue in this particular bill . 
faith-based institutions out there , which are not rich , are still nevertheless effective . 
they care . 
they have the same goal as we do . 
our goal should be to try to join hands to help all the micaelas in the world solve the problem of employment , retraining , and servicing , not to try to change our friends in other particular ways but to join together on a common front , in a common effort , to help people , not to harm people . 
mr. speaker , in closing , i urge adoption of the rule and the underlying legislation .
