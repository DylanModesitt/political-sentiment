mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i certainly look forward to working with the gentleman also . 
mr. speaker , in closing , i would like to just cite a few examples of how republican policies have shortchanged the initiatives which they talked about today . 
instead of having an aggressive policy on math and science education , the bush administration has underinvested in proven math and science instruction . 
today , china graduates four times as many engineers as the united states . 
and south korea , which has one-sixth of the population of the united states , graduates the same number of engineers as the united states . 
instead of keeping the republican promise on education , president bush has already underfunded no child left behind , his own legislation , his own innovation , he has underfunded by more than $ 40 billion . 
instead of investing in research and development to keep the u.s. on the cutting edge of technological advancement , republicans have cut $ 877 million in federal science and technology funding . 
instead of having a national broadband policy , the bush administration has allowed access to broadband to lag . 
instead of passing the 21st century bill to increase energy independence through advances in cutting-edge technology , the republicans have failed to enact any energy bill at all . 
this resolution before us is a mulligan stew that has been allowed to spoil ; it is a spoiled mulligan stew . 
it is not serious . 
we have 40 minutes to discuss items which would require really 40 days . 
if we were serious , we would have a long discussion of these items before we move on and prepare some real legislation to deal with the shortcomings . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
