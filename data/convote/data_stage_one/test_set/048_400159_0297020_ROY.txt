mr. chairman , there are towns and neighborhoods across america that have tough problems , social crises , that desperately need to be addressed . 
fortunately , there are many organizations in those communities that want to help , and they offer unique and innovative solutions to some of our most challenging needs . 
we must open doors for them and help them help our neighbors . 
that begins by removing the barriers that unnecessarily stand in their way . 
it is essential that we recognize the importance of government working with faith-based providers to help society . 
these organizations are a central part of the fabric of communities across america and we need to ensure that we are removing any obstacles that stand in the way of their ability to help . 
faith-based organizations have a federally-protected right to maintain their religious nature and character through those they hire . 
organizations willing to serve their communities by participating in federal programs should not be forced to give up that right . 
we must pass this legislation with a clear message from congress to our faith-based leaders : we need your service and we want to assist you in delivering for us and for the most vulnerable in our society . 
i urge my colleagues to vote against any amendment that would remove the important religious freedom protections these organizations need and deserve .
