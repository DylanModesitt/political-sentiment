mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of the flake-schiff amendment . 
this is another effort in our continuation to support section 215 in all of its aspects , with the protections that i think are reasonable that allow us to take into consideration some of the concerns that people have expressed , even though there have been no examples , i repeat , no examples of abuses under this act . 
the justice department has told us they have not used this section in the area of libraries . 
therefore , i hope they would not object to the gentleman 's amendment , because this is going to be used very , very seldom , based on past history . 
yet , it is relevant , and we already discussed the ways in which it may be relevant to terrorism cases . 
so i would hope that we would have strong support for this amendment , recognizing that this , along with the other changes that we have added to section 215 , will allow us to have this still be utilized and utilized in a way that is not undone , as i thought the amendment that we had on the floor just a few weeks ago would have done so . 
this is a commonsense amendment . 
i hope we will get unanimous support for it .
