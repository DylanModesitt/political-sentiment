mr. chairman , september 11 made it clear that the world had changed , that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies needed to change accordingly . 
democrats and republicans agreed on the need to update the tools necessary for law enforcement to address the threat of terrorism on american soil . 
what started as an effort to protect our country from terror has become a virtually uncontrolled vehicle for government to invade the privacy of every american . 
it was with that possibility in mind that the congress included in the patriot act a provision requiring a review after a few years to determine which parts should be retained , which parts should be modified , and which should be repealed . 
it is evident to me and to many americans that the patriot act is inadequate in its protection of civil liberties . 
section 206 's blanket , roving wiretaps , section 213 's sneak-and-peek searches , and section 215 's expansive power allowing the government to obtain any piece of information on any american are just three examples of how the patriot act is out of control . 
last week , the committee on the judiciary met to address these and other issues in an attempt to bring back some balance to the law enforcement power and civil liberties . 
democrats on the committee offered dozens of amendments in an attempt to control this bill and bring balance to it . 
virtually every single one of these amendments was rejected on a party-line vote . 
most troubling was the extension of sunsetted provisions that should have been allowed to expire or at least require reauthorization in the next 4 years . 
periodically revisiting the patriot act is a good thing . 
to preserve our commitment to making the best and most up-to-date assessment of our law enforcement and intelligence policies , we should include more , not fewer , sunsets and make them shorter , not longer . 
the patriot act was an effort to answer the most difficult question our democracy faces : how much freedom are we willing to give up to feel safe ? 
too much freedom , giving up too much power given to the justice department . 
today we are asking not to hinder the pursuit of terrorists , but to return some sanity and balance to the law .
