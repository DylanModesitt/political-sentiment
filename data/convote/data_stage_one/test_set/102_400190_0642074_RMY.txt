mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
as the gentleman from north dakota recognizes ; and , again , i do not think he meant to misspeak , but the underlying bill , h.r. 8 , does provide a step up in basis of $ 3 million for the surviving spouse and a $ 1.3 million step up in basis for surviving heirs . 
mr. speaker , many have worked on the death tax repeal and going back even to the , i think , family heritage preservation act of 1993 . 
the gentleman from california introduced that bill and i think had 29 cosponsors . 
now , of course , we are over 200 on permanent repeal . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 .
