mr. speaker , i was recently asked by a kind and gentle lady my position on stem cell research . 
this is always a difficult question . 
but i told her , i am in favor of stem cell research , research that uses stem cells from cord blood and adult stem cell sources , research that is already showing great medical promise and avoids the ethically divisive issue of the destruction of an unborn human embryo , an unborn human person . 
frankly , i did not know how she would respond . 
and she went on to tell me that she had ms herself . 
and she told me that if research found a cure using unborn human embryos , that she would not take that cure , that she could not in her conscience take that cure that sacrificed a human life . 
mr. speaker , let us set a new standard , one that aggressively promotes good research to help the sick and injured , one that respects the consciences of tens of millions of americans who do not wish to see their tax dollars used in the destruction of unborn human life , one that supports a consistent life ethic and gives true hope to those who are suffering in our communities .
