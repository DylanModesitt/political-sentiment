mr. speaker , i yield myself 1- 1/4 minutes . 
mr. speaker , i would like to share the words from the president who seems to have sent a different message than my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
president bush said , `` most scientists believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body. '' i hear my friends on the other side of the aisle argue that we really only need cord blood stem cell research , that that will lead us to all that we need . 
and the president said about that , that `` no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent. '' and he said , `` embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body. '' i then hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about research , that this is going to lead to so much more research . 
yet at the same time we have seen no increase , flat-lined spending , budgeting on the national institutes of health , something that many of us , the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 and many of the rest of us , have thought we should increase spending on , medical research all across the board in all kinds of medical research . 
yes , in order to make room for the president 's tax cuts that have gone overwhelmingly to the wealthiest in our country , we have simply cut medical research and not done what we should as a nation do overall in medical research . 
so when i hear my friends talk on this , i do not quite get how this will expand medical research while closing out one whole avenue of medical research and , at the same time , cutting spending on what we should be doing to move our country ahead .
