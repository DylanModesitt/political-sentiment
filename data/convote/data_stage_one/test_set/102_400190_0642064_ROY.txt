mr. speaker , just a quick comment for whatever time i may consume before yielding to the gentleman from south carolina ( mr. barrett ) xz4000160 . 
did i hear the last speaker correctly , that we have given away , whose money is that ? 
it would be the american taxpayers ' money , who are probably , even as we speak , trying to grapple with those forms as they have tax day coming , as the income tax payers of america that provide for the comfortable living that he and i enjoy .
