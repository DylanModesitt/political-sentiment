mr. chairman , i would like to particularly thank the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) and the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 , subcommittee chairman , for this bill . 
from my perspective this is a good bill . 
and i think there are several points i would like to make . 
first of all , it consolidates programs and creates efficiencies . 
it gives state and local officials more flexibility , which is always important . 
and the $ 3 , 000 reemployment accounts to purchase needed services to ensure reemployment seem to me to be a good idea because ofttimes when a person is trying to get back on their feet , they need to have money to pay for child care . 
they need transportation . 
it allows them to get reestablished , and we think this is certainly very helpful . 
and then it also allows faith-based organizations to offer job training service . 
we think this is important . 
i would like to amplify on that just a little bit . 
number one , faith-based organizations often provide services more efficiently than state or federal agencies . 
the salvation army , catholic charities , jewish federation are all extremely efficient and they are very cost effective . 
secondly , faith-based organizations often go where others will not go or do not go . 
in inner cities , and sometimes our rural areas , we find that they are very effective . 
faith-based organizations are by law allowed to hire employees to provide services which conform to the mission of the faith-based organization . 
this right was affirmed by the 1964 civil rights act and the 1987 supreme court decision , corporation of the presiding bishop versus amos . 
so we think there is ample legal justification for this . 
number four , faith-based organization employees must often wear many hats . 
for instance , a music director at a church may also work at the job training center in the afternoon . 
a sunday school superintendent may also run a head start program at the faith-based organization . 
so it is unreasonable and contrary to establish law to force faith-based organizations to hire employees who do not share the faith-based organization 's mission . 
we think this makes perfect sense . 
this is a good bill and i urge support for it .
