mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute . 
mr. chairman , i rarely disagree with my friend from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 , but i want to take some time to correct the record . 
the delayed notification or so-called `` sneak-and-peek '' warrants were authorized in the late seventies for purposes of racketeering and drug-trafficking investigations and were held constitutional by the supreme court in the early eighties as not violative of the fourth amendment . 
what the patriot act did was expand this previously existing authority to terrorism investigations . 
so if the patriot act never existed , the 18 instances where the delayed-notification warrants were used for terrorism investigations would have been illegal . 
but all of the other investigations that the gentleman from north carolina referred to would have been legal under existing practice which have been held constitutional . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
