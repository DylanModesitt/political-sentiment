madam speaker , i rise today to address the many troubling issues associated with the reauthorization of the patriot act . 
following the 9/11 terrorist attacks , this congress was faced with the difficult task of revamping our intelligence system . 
however , the patriot act is flawed with over-reaching provisions that lack the safeguards to prevent abuse . 
americans deserve a bill that successfully prevents attacks against our country , while protecting our constitutional rights . 
we must address the authority this bill gives , and how it may negatively impact americans . 
most of the provisions within the patriot act are positive measures that successfully protect american citizens . 
however , we can not ignore the provisions that create serious privacy and civil liberty abuses . 
these include : permitting large-scale investigation of americans for `` intelligence purposes. '' having minimal judicial supervision on wiretaps . 
allowing the indefinite detention of non-deportable aliens , even if they are not terrorist suspects . 
the power to conduct secret searches without having to notify the target of the search . 
and the ability to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations . 
america was built on the notion of strong protection for our privacy and civil liberties . 
now is the time to protect our citizens from terrorism while putting forth meaningful reforms .
