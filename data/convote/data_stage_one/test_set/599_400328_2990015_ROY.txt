mr. speaker , the gentleman clearly has come to the floor a little bit early , because all of these things are going to be eligible for debate here in another several hours when we move forward on our deficit reduction package , and the gentleman will have an opportunity to exercise through his vote that savings process , that deficit reduction process . 
but i am just curious , in all the gentleman 's rhetoric , what would you do differently about the continuing resolution that funds government through december 17 until we finish our regular appropriations process ?
