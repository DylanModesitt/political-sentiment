mr. speaker , in the entire realm of human history there exists periods of time when evil people bent on destroying good , wholesome , wonderful ways of life get enough power to try to do that and to create chaos and to literally try to send us into a dark age . 
it happens where books are burned and people live in squalor and fear , and it has happened where al qaeda has gotten a stronghold . 
we can not let that happen here . 
now , as a former judge and appellate judge , chief justice , i am very sensitive to the issues of due process , but we are in a war . 
going back to the civil war when lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus , it is in the constitution , `` the privilege of writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. '' he felt it did . 
we have not suspended writs of habeas corpus , even though we are in a war for our very existence . 
now , there has been oversight . 
there will be oversight , because many of us are deeply concerned about our safety and about our liberties . 
so when the minority whip says , and he says he chooses his words carefully , and he says that this represents a craven , and i know i may look stupid , but i know what `` craven '' means , he says this represents a craven failure of our oversight responsibilities , then it tells me there might be a craven failure of his recognizing the oversight that we have conducted . 
i have been there . 
there have been 11 hearings and 35 witnesses . 
we have delved deeply into this . 
among republicans , we have been deeply divided . 
we have taken each other on . 
i wanted sunsets . 
we have got sunsets on the two most controversial provisions . 
we do not have to wait 10 years , even though that is what the sunset provision says . 
we can come back before then . 
but i am grateful , i am glad for the amendments we were able to inject on providing for an attorney and allowing for appeal under 215 . 
anyway , the gentleman across the aisle says if this is approved , part of our tree of liberty will die . 
i think it is quite clear , if we do not approve this , american people will die . 
if you do not believe it , go look at the reports , as i have .
