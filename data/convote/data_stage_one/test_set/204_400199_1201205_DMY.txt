mr. speaker , i make a simple plea to save lives by supporting h.r. 810 , the degette/castle bill , and to help americans who are suffering . 
i ask for a `` yes '' vote on h.r. 810 simply to save lives . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the `` stem cell research enhancement act of 2005. '' as a supporter of the bill , i would argue that it is necessary to expand the number of stem cell lines that can be used in federally funded research in order to accelerate scientific progress toward the cures and treatments for a wide variety of diseases and debilitating health conditions -- including parkinson 's disease , diabetes , alzheimer 's disease , als , cancer , and spinal cord injuries . 
according to the national institutes of health , nih , of the 78 stem cell lines that were declared eligible for federal funding in 2001 , only about 22 lines are actually available for study by and distribution to researchers . 
further , nih concludes that these stem cell lines are contaminated with `` mouse feeder '' cells , making their therapeutic use for humans uncertain . 
these nih-approved lines lack the genetic diversity that researchers need in order to create effective treatments for millions of americans . 
h.r. 810 would expand the number of stem cell lines that would be made available under strict ethical guidelines . 
the stem cells would be derived from excess frozen fertilized embryos that would otherwise be discarded . 
it is estimated that there are currently about 400 , 000 frozen ivf embryos , which would be destroyed if they are not donated for research . 
the embryos could be used only if the donors give their informed , written consent and receive no money or other inducement in exchange for their embryos . 
it is important for me to note that it is simply not true that adult stem cells offer the same , or better , potential for treating disease as embryonic stem cells . 
while embryonic stem cells have qualities that give them the potential to treat a wide variety of diseases and injuries , adult stem cells do not have those same qualities . 
unlike embryonic stem cells , adult stem cells can not be induced to develop into any type of cell . 
furthermore , adult stem cells may not exist for certain tissues , and adult stem cells are difficult to identify , purify , and grow . 
unless federal funding for stem cell research is expanded , the united states stands in real danger of falling behind other countries in this promising area of research . 
researchers have already moved to other countries , such as great britain , which have more supportive policies . 
the recent announcement that south korean researchers have produced cloned human embryos that are genetic twins of patients with various diseases , and have derived stem cells from them , shows just how far that country is going . 
while it is important to recognize that this bill has nothing to do with cloning , it is also important to recognize that other countries are moving ahead in stem cell research . 
this bill provides a limited -- but nonetheless highly significant -- change in current policy that would result in making many more lines of stem cells available for research . 
it would do so under strict ethical guidelines . 
the measure has widespread bipartisan support . 
passage of this bill would provide hope for those millions of americans suffering from diseases that may be treated or even cured as a result of stem cell research before concluding , i would just mention that the national academy of sciences , nas , recently issued a set of guidelines to ensure that human embryonic stem cell research is conducted in a safe and ethical manner . 
because of the limitations of the current federal policy , only 22 stem cell lines are eligible for federal research and fall under the jurisdiction of national institutes of health guidelines . 
specifically , h.r. 810 requires that : the stem cells must be derived from human embryos that were donated from in vitro fertilization clinics , and that were created for the purpose of fertility treatment , but were in excess of the clinical need of the people seeking such treatment ; the embryos would not have been used for fertility treatment , and would otherwise be discarded ; the individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the embryos with informed written consent and without any financial payment or other inducement to make the donation . 
in addition , the bill requires that not later than 60 days after enactment , hhs , in consultation with the national institutes of health , issue final guidelines to carry out the requirements of this bill . 
finally , the measure requires hhs to report annually to congress on the activities carried out under this bill . 
the report must include a description of whether , and to what extent , these activities were carried out in accordance with the requirements of this bill . 
in closing , i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 810 . 
listen to the following news reports which indicate this research as viable and of great need for so many . 
since the federal government 's science officials have abdicated their traditional role in setting ethical rules for medical experimentation , the national academy of sciences has filled the void with useful guidelines for research with human embryonic stem cells . 
acting on behalf of scientists around the country , the nas last week issued stem cell research guidelines that should become a blueprint for ethical behavior in both the public and private sector . 
the atlanta journal constitution , may 3 , 2005 . 
kudos to the national academy of sciences for ably filling the breach caused by the absence of federal guidelines on human embryonic stem cell research . 
while we prefer that rules governing research on human tissues be federal and enforceable , the national academy of sciences ' new voluntary guidelines are a necessary stand-in . 
the baltimore sun , may 3 , 2005 . 
with the federal government 's role limited , research has been proceeding without clear , consistent guidelines ... ... .these and other recommendations are a good start toward ensuring that stem cell research is conducted in an ethical way ... .. 
the federal government is still not doing all that it should , but these recommendations ought at least to help the private companies and states that are moving ahead with research that offers so much hope for many americans . 
the winston-salem journal , may 3 , 2005 . 
the national academy of sciences gave a much needed boost to embryonic stem cell research last week when it issued ethics guidelines that should help researchers find a clear path through a minefield of controversial issues . 
. 
. 
they will give practicing scientists the assurance that they can proceed with their work while adhering to principles endorsed by a panel of distinguished scientists , ethicist , and others .
