we are working with your side on a unanimous-consent request to bring the bill up even without a rule . 
hopefully , we can agree to a lengthy debate . 
this issue is so important for an up-and-down vote . 
hopefully , we could have a full and open debate on this very important issue . 
and it will be hopefully done under a unanimous-consent request that will be worked out with your side , probably on monday .
