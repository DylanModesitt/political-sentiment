mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of his amendment . 
as the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence just said , we did try to work out a unanimous consent request . 
we agreed among us , but , sadly , others in this body did not agree . 
the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is right . 
this is a modest amendment that will yield good information so that we will proceed to do data mining in an efficient way consistent with protecting the civil liberties of law-abiding americans . 
that is all it does . 
it requires only the justice department to prepare a report , not the defense department and not other departments in the government . 
so my view is that we should vote for this amendment now and perfect it later . 
i agree with the chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
it will help us do data mining the right way , and america will be safer for it .
