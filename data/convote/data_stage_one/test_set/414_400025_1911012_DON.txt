mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , in the course of yielding to my next speaker , i just want to remind the body it is one report , once a year , with anything that would tip off anybody about anything that we would not want to happen to be in a classified form , even in the amendment form without modification . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , ranking member of the permanent select committee on intelligence .
