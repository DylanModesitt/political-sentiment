mr. speaker , that was the ploy of your party . 
that is not mine , but i would take the time to keep congress here . 
what we are talking about is congress going on vacation , congress going away for 2 weeks , have thanksgiving at home , while we are taking food out of the mouths of kids and depriving students of loans through the reconciliation bill , borrowing $ 1.3 billion a day on behalf of the american taxpayers and getting them by another $ 39 billion . 
that is what we are talking about . 
on the reconciliation vote , if you would bring the reconciliation bill up as an open rule , you know that is a closed rule , too . 
you are negotiating cuts only with your side of the aisle . 
you do not intend to get a single democratic vote ; and the biggest cut in the bill is student loans , the party of opportunity . 
the second biggest cut in the bill is medicaid ; dump those problems on the states and deprive people of needed health care . 
then , of course , we have the cuts in food security and other things in that bill . 
but we are not going to be allowed to offer amendments to cut star wars , the return to the moon for $ 100 billion , corporate farm subsidies , tax giveaways . 
we will not be allowed to offer any amendments during the consideration of that bill . 
i would stay here through next week and have debate day after day and go through a series of amendments up or down on bringing some fiscal responsibility to this congress .
