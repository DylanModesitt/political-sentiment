i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of his amendment . 
and let me say first that the amendment that was made by the patriot act to allow a federal judge , and only a federal judge , to authorize a roving wiretap simply brought the law up to where the technology has gone because before the patriot act was passed you could not get an effective wiretap order on a cell phone . 
so the terrorists and the drug smugglers and the racketeers simply conducted their business on cell phones because you could not determine whether or not the cell phone was actually being used within the district in which the federal court that issued the roving wiretap order sat . 
so by passing the patriot act we were able to get the justice department the authority to ask a federal judge to give a wiretap order against the cell phone or any communications device that might be used by the target . 
and that gets around the disposable cell phone issue . 
the issa amendment merely states that the judge has to be notified at the earliest reasonable time , but no later than 15 days after a roving wiretap order directs surveillance at a location not known at the time when the wiretap order was issued . 
and this increases judicial supervision and accountability and protects the civil liberties of the american people . 
now , earlier today both the minority leader and her deputy , the minority whip , were talking about the fact that there has been no oversight done by the judiciary committee over the patriot act . 
that , frankly , insults what both democrats and republicans have done on oversight of the patriot act on a bipartisan basis . 
right here is the result of the oversight that the judiciary committee has done in the last 3 1/2 years on this law . 
this is a stack of paper that is almost 2 feet high . 
i doubt that any other committee of congress has done as much oversight on a single law as my committee has done on the patriot act .
