mr. chairman , i support the gentleman 's amendment and i hope we can adopt it fairly quickly . 
what this amendment does is simply add the following predicates to allow law enforcement to go to a judge to seek a wiretap order : crimes of terrorism such as arson , plastic explosives , attacks on a federal facility with firearms , and conspiracy to harm persons or property overseas . 
i think all of these are legitimate predicates . 
i would hope the gentleman 's amendment is adopted , and thank him for yielding .
