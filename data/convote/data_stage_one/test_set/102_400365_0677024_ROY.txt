mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute . 
mr. speaker , unfortunately what the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 said is not correct . 
there is a means test that is contained in this bill , but 11 united states code , section 1307 which permits the conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case is not amended at all in any respect . 
i would just like to read 11 u.s.c . 
1307 ( a ) : `` a debtor may convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 7 of this title at any time . 
any waiver of the right to convert under this subsection is unenforceable. '' so if chapter 13 is such a straight jacket , the way out is through the conversion as provided for in section 1307 . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr. chabot ) xz4000710 .
