mr. chairman , this has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with sending messages about terrorism . 
it is trying to find out what is happening in the federal government today , and we do not know . 
we have heard a lot today about oversight and accountability . 
that is what we are trying to do here . 
remember the so-called total information program that was the brainchild of the former national security administrator that we funded to the tune of $ 170 million , and then defunded it ? 
it was too late . 
we wasted $ 170 million . 
that is what this is about . 
it is providing the tools to the united states congress to do its constitutional job of oversight . 
mr. chairman , do you know what ? 
we do not know what is happening . 
that is the real secret as far as the american people are concerned . 
we stumble on these things .
