i thank the gentleman for that information and would ask that certainly the substantive democratic amendments be made in order . 
this , obviously , is a very important bill , a large sum of money , critically important at a time when we are confronting terrorists in iraq and around the world and our men and women are in harm 's way . 
all of us want to make sure that we have our ideas on how we can best strengthen our efforts in that bill . 
so to the extent that the leader can prevail upon the rules committee to allow such amendments as democratic members and , for that matter , republican members want to offer , i think that would be in the best interests of full consideration . 
mr. leader , the stem cell research legislation you indicate will be on tuesday . 
it is my understanding that that bill will be brought to the floor and that it will not be subject to amendment ; it will be considered as reported out of committee . 
is that accurate ?
