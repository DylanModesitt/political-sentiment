madam speaker , i rise in strong opposition to the patriot act conference report . 
due to concerns about civil liberties infringement , i voted against the original patriot act in 2001 and the house patriot act reauthorization bill earlier this summer . 
the democratic fabric of this country was founded on checks and balances but the patriot act contains neither . 
in 1775 , one of our nation 's true patriots , benjamin franklin , said `` they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. '' this legislation tramples on the essential liberties that our founding fathers wanted to ensure . 
they understood that lowering our civil liberties standards would not ensure safety ; but it would undermine the relationship of this proud democracy with its citizens . 
i believe that the founders of this country would be rolling in their graves to hear the claims this administration and republican leadership make in the name of safety from terrorists . 
do you really feel safer knowing that the government is allowed to investigate personal records without you knowing ? 
do you feel safer knowing that the government can issue blank wire tap orders without identifying the line , place or person it wishes to investigate ? 
do you really feel safer knowing that if you or your neighbor were accused that documents used against you would not be subject to judicial review ? 
do you really feel safer that your library records can be considered intelligence in an investigative report ? 
i can not with a clean conscience support this bill which gives government unnecessary access to the lives of innocent americans and tramples on their civil rights . 
madam speaker , i urge a `` no '' vote on this piece of legislation that flies in the face of our forefathers .
