madam speaker , i want to make two points : one , the bad parts about section 215 and section 505 are not that , under certain circumstances , the fbi or other investigative agencies can get information from libraries . 
no one is proposing , as mr. sensenbrenner xz4003650 said , to say that libraries are totally sacrosanct . 
the bad part is that the fbi can get all this private personal information without any proper or adequate judicial review and then can tell them , shut up , do not tell the victim about it , and that gag order also operates without any real judicial review . 
that is the real issue . 
secondly , the gentleman from wisconsin is attempting to do something , i think , improper , and that is , he tells us you can not change the patriot act . 
there are good things in this bill , things we need , which is true , but you have got to take it or leave it , because your 3-month extension i will not allow to go through . 
we will blackmail this house . 
if you do not pass the bill as is today , if it expires , there will be blood on your hands , because he and his side of the aisle will not allow a 3-month extension . 
well , if there is fault , if there is real danger by not extending the patriot act , it is on that side of the aisle by refusing a 3-month extension so that we can get it right . 
this country should not be subjected to that kind of blackmail . 
the senate has real questions . 
many liberals , many conservatives , have real questions about this bill . 
it should be worked out , and if it takes an additional 3 months , let it be . 
but we , this house , should not be told , take it or leave it , because if you do not take it the way it is , we will not permit a 3-month extension ; there will be dangers to the republic . 
without a 3-month extension , there will be blood on your hands . 
that is not the way to legislate . 
that is not proper procedure . 
that is not respectful of the constitution . 
it is not respectful of the people of this country . 
it is not respectful of the members of this house .
