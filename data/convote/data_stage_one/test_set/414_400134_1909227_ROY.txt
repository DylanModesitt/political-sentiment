mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i am offering this amendment today with the gentleman from idaho ( mr. otter ) xz4003050 , my fellow co-chairman of the patriot act reform caucus . 
this amendment addresses two important issues regarding delayed notification of the so-called sneak-and-peek searches . 
the amendment removes the clause that allows judges , when deciding whether initially to grant a sneak-and-peek search , to allow it for the reason that it would unduly delay a trial to notify the target of the search . 
this amendment strikes `` unduly delaying a trial '' because we believe it is too low a standard to allow for a delayed notification search under the adverse impact clause of section 2705 of title xviii . 
this amendment also requires on an annual basis that the administrative office of the courts must report to the house and senate judiciary committees on the number of search warrants granted and the number of delayed notices authorized . 
the aoc would also be required to indicate the cause of delay in each instance . 
this important information will help improve congress ' oversight role on delayed notification for so-called sneak-and-peak searches in the future by providing members with this information on an annual basis . 
again , i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and his staff for once again working to address the concerns we had on delayed notification . 
i urge my colleagues to accept this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 .
