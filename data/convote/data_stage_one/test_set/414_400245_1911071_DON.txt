mr. chairman , having just seen this amendment for the first time today , there are questions that are raised . 
i understand what the intent is , and perhaps if this passes we can clarify this in a conference committee ; but i wonder about the liabilities of the banking industry that acts innocently to help immigrants transmit funds home . 
the banks in california have been encouraged to regularize the remittance program . 
we talk sometimes about illegal immigration , and that is not anything that any of us approve of ; but it is not the same as terrorism , and it is also not the same as those immigrants . 
it is also a financial services industry . 
i do wish we could have heard from the financial services industry on this point because certainly it deserves some clarification . 
maybe it does not do what has been suggested . 
we have had some communications from those who are concerned it does . 
but i do want to raise that on behalf of the california banking industry that has really stepped up to avoid the fraud and crime that has occurred with remittances before they did .
