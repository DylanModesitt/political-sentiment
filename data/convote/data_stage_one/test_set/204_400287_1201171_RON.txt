mr. speaker , i recently had a granddaughter born . 
i looked at that little baby , and i was in love with her when i went to ultrasound and we saw her , even before she was born . 
when i saw the little snowflake children , i thought about their humanness . 
i thought about what joy they brought to their families . 
i thought about little children that needed to be comforted when they were hurt , little children that wanted to be put to bed at night with a kiss and a story , their wonderful humanness , and i thought about what the american people think of babies and how we cherish them . 
when i see these little children , i know their intrinsic value ; and how we treat people , in whatever form of development , depends on how we perceive them . 
the embryo is a human being at an early stage of development . 
when we talk to many who have great knowledge about this , and i appreciate the doctors in our presence , we should never spend the american taxpayers ' dollars to take the life of an innocent human being . 
as i look at this bill , i know it is very complex ; but we need to always support human life .
