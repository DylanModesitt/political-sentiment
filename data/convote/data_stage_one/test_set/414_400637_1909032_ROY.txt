mr. chairman , section 215 of the patriot act pertains to the government 's abilities to gain access to what we commonly refer to as business records , records compiled by a business or an institution pertaining to a customer or visitor to that entity . 
this provision has come to be known as the `` library provision '' because many librarians and civil libertarians are concerned that this provision of the patriot act could authorize the government to pour through the library records of everyday private citizens . 
now , it is my understanding that your version of the bill has added protections to ensure that law-abiding citizens and residents of the united states do not see their cherished civil liberties violated . 
specifically , the bill states that no search can be conducted unless , i repeat , unless a federal judge impaneled at the foreign intelligence surveillance court makes a finding that the information likely to be obtained concerns an ongoing investigation ; repeat , an ongoing investigation to prevent international terrorism , and that that investigation is geared toward gathering foreign intelligence .
