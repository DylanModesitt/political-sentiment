i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to this restrictive rule , and i rise in opposition to the underlying bill . 
protecting our homeland from another terrorist attack is among the most important priorities we face . 
we must support our law enforcement officials by providing them with the proper resources and modern technologies to combat terrorism . 
there is a delicate balance that must be maintained between security and liberty . 
i believe that this bill sacrifices too much of our liberty . 
i know there is a lot of anguish in the house today about this bill . 
this morning 's incidents on the london subway only serve to heighten that anxiety . 
but democracy takes courage , mr. speaker . 
it takes the courage not to abandon our most deeply held principles . 
it takes the courage not to subject our citizens to unwarranted intrusions into their privacy . 
it takes the courage to say to the terrorists , you will not succeed in changing our way of life . 
mr. speaker , i hear all the time from all types of people that 9/11 has changed everything . 
i hope not , mr. speaker . 
i hope that those terrible attacks have not served to undermine our constitution , to weaken our respect for civil liberties , to chip away at the values that not only make this country unique but also make us a beacon of hope for the rest of the world . 
while the government should be provided with the necessary resources to protect the homeland , it should not be given a free pass to threaten and abuse the rights and liberties of our own citizens . 
safeguards are key , and congress in its vital function of oversight is one of government 's most important safeguards . 
many of the provisions in the patriot act were sunsetted back in 2001 so that congress could evaluate and fix them if necessary . 
these time limits on certain provisions serve as critical checks on the executive branch . 
they serve as a reminder that congress is paying attention and that if the new powers are abused , they will not be renewed . 
we know from our own history that abuses of law enforcement powers are all too common . 
we must remember the wiretaps and secret surveillance on leaders in the civil rights and antiwar movements , and we must vow to never let those abuses happen again . 
some of the powers granted to the executive branch in this bill are simply too broad : secret surveillance of library and bookstore records ; roving wiretaps ; sneak-and-peek searches ; and overly broad subpoena power . 
however , i realize there is little chance of removing the majority of these dangerous provisions from this bill . 
at the very least , i urge my colleagues to fulfill their responsibilities and vote to sunset all of these provisions again for a short period of time . 
further , since the patriot act was adopted , congress has received far too little information about its uses . 
how can we make these provisions permanent when the department of justice , fbi , and other government agencies will not report to congress or the american people how these provisions are being implemented ? 
mr. speaker , privacy is not a convenient luxury . 
it is a fundamental right . 
we need a bill that achieves the appropriate balance between liberty and security , a bill that combats terrorism vigilantly , but that is also consistent with the rights and liberties provided in the constitution of the united states . 
in my opinion , this bill is not it . 
i fear that if this bill becomes law , a part of our tree of liberty will die . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule , and i urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation .
