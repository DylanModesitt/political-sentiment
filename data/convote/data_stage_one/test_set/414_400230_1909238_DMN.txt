mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time . 
i rise in support of the flake-otter sneak-and-peek amendment to drop this provision . 
keeping america safe is not a partisan issue ; but , unfortunately , several provisions of h.r. 3199 are . 
now , we could have had a bipartisan solution that extends the provisions that are effective and modifies those that need changes . 
this amendment addresses one of those changes by preventing the use of sneak-and-peek searches when the sole purpose of the delayed notification is to postpone a trial . 
the current provision is too broad , and this amendment would limit these searches to terrorism cases . 
now , i recognize the need for our laws to keep pace with new technology and a changing world , and i am committed to ensuring that our law enforcement has the tools they need to keep our nation safe . 
however , providing these tools need not come at the expense of the liberties and freedoms that we hold so dear . 
if we cede these , we have already given up the very values the terrorists are trying to destroy . 
i look forward to working with my colleagues to make many changes to h.r. 3199 to fight terrorism and to protect our freedoms . 
i urge the senate to take a more bipartisan approach to the renewal of the usa patriot act , and i hope that they are more open to sunsets which require congress to review the act , extend what is working , and change what is not . 
sunsets would make the bill better , but the rule does not permit us to vote on this important modification . 
i hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this responsible amendment .
