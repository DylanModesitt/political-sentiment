mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
let me just conclude by thanking the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for running a fair and thorough process . 
much has been said about these things being rushed through . 
i can tell my colleagues that over the past 12 months or so , we have had 12 hearings on this subject , 35 witnesses . 
we have gone through this very thoroughly . 
on each of these sections that we are dealing with , we heard excellent testimony from the administration , from other witnesses , from experts in the field ; and that is why these amendments have been crafted . 
we have sought to protect the civil liberties of americans every bit as much as we can here , while offering effective tools for the war on terrorism , giving the administration the tools that they need to fight this war . 
i am persuaded that we have done well with this section , with section 215 , that we have put the protections that we need in place ; and i would urge my colleagues to support this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
