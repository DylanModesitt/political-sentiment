mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
mr. chairman , just to acknowledge that as the chairman has indicated , some of these roving wiretaps do put us into the 21st century with the use of cell phones and disposable cell phones . 
so the roving wiretap is necessary . 
but it needs oversight . 
and i think this amendment will go a long way to making sure that that process is not abused . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from iowa ( mr. boswell ) xz4000420 .
