mr. chairman , if the gentleman will continue to yield , there is a disagreement on what the court was actually ruling on , whether they were ruling on the access to counsel or , my understanding of it , whether or not the request itself was unconstitutional . 
if that is the case , let the legal process take its course . 
but i think what we need to do here is make sure that the agencies have the tools they need , offering the protections we are offering here .
