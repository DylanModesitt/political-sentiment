mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , first of all , i want to commend the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. mack ) xz4006220 for partnering with us and structuring this motion to instruct conferees . 
i want to express appreciation to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his constructive comments and for his support of the motion to instruct . 
the motion to instruct promotes accountability . 
it assures that we remain in a strong position in our oversight function . 
recent history clearly shows that in the absence of a near-term sunset we will not get answers to our questions about how controversial law enforcement powers are being used . 
in the absence of a near-term sunset , we can not ensure that civil liberties are being protected . 
this is not a matter about what the department of justice has done in the past , and i differ with the gentleman from wisconsin on this matter . 
this is all about what the department of justice may do in the future . 
and having near-term sunsets will ensure that we can perform oversight over that performance . 
sunsets do not prevent law enforcement from using the broad powers the patriot act confers , but sunsets promote accountability . 
they ensure we get the information necessary to conduct oversight and to make decisions about whether powers that are subject to abuse should be contended . 
adopt this motion , let us adopt the senate 's 4-year sunsets and , in doing so , further the cause of protecting americans ' civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , i urge approval of the motion to instruct .
