mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
just to answer a couple of points : what we do in the amendment is to help to provide opportunities for a series of predicate offenses . 
so what you get is an opportunity to follow through a number of transactions to show that there is money laundering . 
and we have added a couple of new offenses , but there can be a mixture of some legal and illegal transactions to do that . 
so if the concern is that a grandmother transmitting money to her family or the other way around , it is not going to trigger a problem under this amendment . 
it is very clear that there would have to be a series of transactions that are suspect in order for this law to be triggered ; and , obviously , there has to be some suspicion of financing terrorism before law enforcement would move forward with that kind of prosecution .
