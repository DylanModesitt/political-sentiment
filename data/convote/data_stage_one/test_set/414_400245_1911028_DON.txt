mr. chairman , i would like to concur with the comments made by the ranking member , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , and to thank my colleague from california for the amendment , and just note that as i read through it and agreed with this , and i thank the gentleman for offering the amendment , it occurs to me that there are a few other items that perhaps should have been included , and i am hopeful that the committee might , we do not have a sunset , but we might actually spend some time scrubbing the code and making sure that we have scooped them all up in an appropriate way .
