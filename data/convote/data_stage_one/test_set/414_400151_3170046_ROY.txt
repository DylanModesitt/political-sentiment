madam speaker , i will close this debate by again thanking chairmen sensenbrenner and king for their work on this important conference report . 
this bill is a testament to our open legislative process . 
conservatives , liberals , moderates , democrats , republicans , independents , the aclu , the department of justice and various other organizations have all had the opportunity to voice their thoughts and concerns on the underlying bill . 
i believe , madam speaker , the final product is solid and legal , does not violate our constitutional rights guaranteed by the fourth amendment , and will serve as an important framework to fight terrorism , protect civil liberties and thereby further strengthen america . 
again , i want to encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support both the rule and the underlying bill . 
madam speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
the previous question was ordered . 
the resolution was agreed to . 
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .
