mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
the time is insufficient , not only to explain my position , but also the time for consideration of this bill has been insufficient . 
thirty-two years ago , we passed a bill that a republican president , richard nixon , signed to protect and conserve species in danger of extinction . 
unfortunately , though , the underlying bill , which has been fast-tracked since its introduction , would substantially undermine the endangered species act . 
that is what this is about . 
for example , this bill would undermine the ability of the responsible federal agencies to ably perform their oversight roles , and it fails to recognize the importance of sound science to species recovery and restoration . 
the bill also creates a fiscally irresponsible , open-ended entitlement program that effectively pays landowners to comply with the law . 
in contrast , the bipartisan substitute offered by the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 has a far more reasoned approach . 
it ensures consultation between the secretary and other federal agencies with proposed actions that may jeopardize species . 
it strengthens the definition of what constitutes jeopardy and requires the secretary to ensure that proposed recovery plans identify and include areas necessary for species survival . 
i urge support of the substitute and opposition to the underlying bill . 
mr. chairman . 
thirty-two years ago , congress passed and a republican president -- richard nixon -- signed the endangered species act to protect and conserve species in danger of extinction . 
today , there are 1 , 268 species listed as endangered or threatened in the united states , including 26 in the state of maryland . 
this law is not perfect , but it has been very successful . 
roughly 40 percent of listed species have witnessed the stabilization or growth of their populations . 
and , less than one percent have been declared extinct since the law 's enactment . 
the fact is , this law has enabled the very survival of some of our most vulnerable species -- including the bald eagle , the gray wolf , the california condor , and the whooping crane . 
unfortunately , though , the underlying bill -- which has been fast-tracked since its introduction last week -- would substantially undermine the endangered species act . 
for example , this bill would undermine the ability of the responsible federal agencies -- the departments of commerce and interior -- to ably perform their oversight roles , and it fails to recognize the importance of sound science to species recovery and restoration . 
the bill also creates a fiscally irresponsible , open-ended entitlement program that effectively pays landowners to comply with the law . 
in contrast , the bipartisan substitute offers a far more reasoned approach . 
it ensures consultation between the secretary and other federal agencies with proposed actions that may jeopardize species . 
it strengthens the definition of what constitutes jeopardy and requires the secretary to ensure that proposed recovery plans identify and include areas necessary for species survival . 
the substitute also creates conservation programs that would provide technical and financial assistance to landowners committed to efforts that protect species . 
mr. chairman , we have a responsibility to protect our environment -- as well as the diverse forms of life that share it . 
the bipartisan substitute will help us achieve the goal . 
i urge my colleagues to support it .
