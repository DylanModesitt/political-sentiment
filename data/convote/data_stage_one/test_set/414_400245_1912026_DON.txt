mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
although the gentleman from texas ( mr. paul ) xz4003110 and i do not always vote together , i think he speaks wisdom this evening on the need to move beyond the narrow confines of this act . 
clearly we do need to and we have broken down the walls between law enforcement and the intelligence community so that we can piece together the full picture and connect the dots . 
we need to do a much better job of protecting america from terrorists by taking those steps we can . 
he is right to offer this sense of the congress amendment . 
we need to have more vigorous action in addition to the sense of the congress activity . 
all of us believe we ought to fight terrorism . 
many of us are concerned that we have failed to do the balance of privacy and the constitution in some parts of the 16 provisions that are before us this evening . 
as we know , most of the patriot act is actually not before the house of representatives this evening . 
it is only 16 provisions , and of those 16 provisions , there are concerns about a few of them . 
but those are serious concerns , and we believe that those concerns can be dealt with . 
we are hopeful that , as this process moves forward , that the senate that has taken these issues of civil liberties more to heart on a bipartisan and i would add unanimous basis may in the end prevail so that those who are troubled by the failure to really deal with some of the constitutional issues will in the end be able to support a bill at least at the end of a conference process . 
but i do commend the gentleman for offering his amendment . 
it does not solve the other problems , but it is the right thing to do , and i look forward to supporting it . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
