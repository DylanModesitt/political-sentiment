mr. chairman , so the debate here boils down to one of two issues , you believe that if these faith-based organizations want to participate in these programs that they have to give up their rights under the 1964 civil rights act . 
we believe and the majority of this house has believed on a number of occasions as we have had this vote , that faith-based organizations who want to help the neediest of the needy should in fact be able to have their rights under the 1964 civil rights act . 
it is just as simple as that . 
so i would ask my colleagues as they look at this bill and look at this amendment to support the work that we have done , to allow these groups to participate . 
they do good work . 
there is no reason why that they can not partner with the federal government to help us in our effort to help the neediest of the needy , and to help improve the prospects for job training and retraining to help all americans participate in the 21st century economy and give them a chance to succeed at the american dream . 
mr. chairman , i ask my colleagues to vote against the scott amendment .
