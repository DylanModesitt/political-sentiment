mr. speaker , for clarification , i acknowledge that the gentleman from oregon sent his amendment to the committee on rules . 
my point was during the markup of the rule , there was no attempt on the other side to amend the rule to make his amendment in order . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest ) xz4001490 , a member of the committee on resources .
