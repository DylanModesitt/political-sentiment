mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i ask for a `` no '' vote on the previous question so i can amend the rule and allow the house , instead of h. res. 437 , to consider h.r. 3764 , which creates an independent 9/11-like commission to investigate the events involving hurricane katrina . 
i offered this amendment in the committee on rules last night , but , sadly , it was rejected . 
i want to reiterate that 76 percent of americans in a recent abc/washington post poll preferred that a commission of outside experts , similar in nature to the 9/11 commission , and , in fact , i wish for the same people , to investigate the devastating events surrounding hurricane katrina , and that is not just democrats that were asked . 
sixty-four percent of republicans in that same poll said they , too , supported an independent commission to investigate the government 's preparedness and response effort . 
please vote `` no '' on the previous question so we can authorize an independent commission that will not be influenced by partisan politics instead of a republican-controlled committee investigating the failings of a republican-controlled administration . 
too many people 's lives were turned upside down because of the failure of governmental officials to adequately prepare for and respond to the impact of hurricane katrina . 
let us not fail them a second time . 
i urge a `` no '' vote . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question .
