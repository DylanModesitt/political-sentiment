mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me . 
basically , this is an amendment supported , i am happy to say , by the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , that simply does one thing : it requires the attorney general to report to congress once a year on a survey that it seeks from other agencies of the federal government surveying data-mining technologies in use or in development at federal departments and agencies . 
the modification that i seek simply makes clear that , first of all , any classified information will be submitted in a classified annex and , secondly , that any information regarding data-mining technologies that deals with the sources , intelligence sources and methods , will be available only in the annex to the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate select committee on intelligence ; in other words , that to the extent this survey produces anything which should either be classified or deals with sources and methods , the traditional procedures for where that material goes will be maintained .
