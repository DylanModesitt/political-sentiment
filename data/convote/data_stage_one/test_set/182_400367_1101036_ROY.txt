mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , today we have had a great debate . 
a few people showed up and expressed some concern about what they had , and i would like to address that so that the members are aware . 
the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 and the gentleman from georgia ( mr. barrow ) xz4006280 did come before the committee on rules . 
the committee on rules did not put it in the bill , but it is not in the democrat substitute either , so the democrat leadership chose not to include that in their substitute . 
we also had some discussion about air cargo . 
for those members who are interested , air cargo will be in the substitute ; it will be in section 519 . 
republicans addressed the issue . 
we have doubled the number of air cargo inspectors that would be at the airports to make sure that we are looking at the cargo . 
today has been a good debate , an opportunity for members to come forth and speak about the important things about this bill . 
the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 has our admiration . 
he has done a great job . 
the committee on rules i believe did a fair job . 
i would also at this time like to thank the white house and the liaisons that the white house provided to us , brian conklin for his great leadership , chris frech for his hard work with us , and certainly their superstar at the white house , elan elinjg , who took time to make sure that members were updated , not only about the position of the administration , but about how they could work closely with members of congress . 
so i think today has been another successful opportunity for us to begin the 5 hours of debate that will take place today where every member will have an opportunity to come down and express themselves and where we will have a democrat substitute that will be over 200 pages where they are able to express the things which they believe are best . 
members of congress will be able to vote and a decision can be made today . 
mr. speaker , i am proud of this process .
