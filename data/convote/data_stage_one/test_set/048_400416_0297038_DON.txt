mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
on october 1 , the bush administration effectively implemented a tax on u.s. entrepreneurship . 
by doubling the fees on 7-a loans , the bush administration has severely limited access to critical source of capital for our nation 's small businesses . 
i want to be on record , and i want every member in this house to be on record about the fact that last july , an amendment to the cjs appropriations that would have protected the 7-a program was approved with strong support . 
the house was on record then , and we should continue to be on record for the small business community . 
this amendment sends a message that congress is not willing to accept the recent policy decisions of the bush administration to further burden u.s. entrepreneurs . 
they are our job creators . 
they drive our economy and they deserve our support . 
our goal is to fully repeal the freeze on the 7-a loans . 
while this amendment will not change the fee structure , it will help entrepreneurs afford this vital source of capital . 
so i therefore urge my colleagues to support this amendment .
