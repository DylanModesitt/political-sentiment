mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 . 
mr. chairman , i believe it is critical for us to make sure we do not change the regulatory landscape on property owners regulated under existing law . 
these individuals , our constituents , are committed to doing what the federal government asked them to do in order to secure authorization to proceed with various activities . 
we should not require those same landowners to renegotiate what they have already agreed to under the new rules of this bill after it is enacted . 
based on that premise , i believe the threatened and endangered species recovery act should include a grandfather clause to cover any esa permits or approvals issued prior to the date of enactment of this bill , not just habitat conservation plans . 
i would inquire , is that the intent of the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 ?
