mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
in reference to a comment made a little bit earlier , not by the previous speaker but by the distinguished minority whip concerning his concern over the fact that the sanders amendment was not made in order , i want to point out the bipartisan amendment by the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 and the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 , that is amendment no . 
59 that was made in order and that will be debated later on this afternoon , stating that the director of the fbi must personally approve any library or bookstore request for records by the fbi under section 215 . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , my colleague on the rules committee .
