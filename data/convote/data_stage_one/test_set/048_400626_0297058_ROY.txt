mr. chairman , i appreciate the opportunity once again to speak on this , and i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment . 
the misunderstandings and confusion and frankly the hyperbole is phenomenal coming out of the other side . 
no one , no one , is encouraging faith-based institutions to discriminate with the language in this bill . 
sometimes i think it is helpful to go back to the original language . 
we have had a lot of reference to title vii of the civil rights acts of 1964 . 
what it says specifically is `` this subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of , '' et cetera . 
it does not say anything about the source of the money . 
nothing . 
there is no mention of the source . 
there has been some discussion about previous language that many members on the other side of the aisle have adopted in previous bills , four pieces of legislation under the clinton administration . 
president clinton himself said that no discrimination with employment in the bills that were adopted , and we have heard about them , the welfare reform , the community renewal tax relief , community services block grant , substance abuse . 
the gentleman from virginia well , the exact identical language in this bill was in those . 
if there is this incredible occurrence that is happening out there with this remarkable discrimination , where are the examples under those bills ? 
where are the examples of discrimination under those bills that have exactly the same language as this bill that we are promoting here ? 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this and to be certain , to be certain , there is no intent or desire on anybody on this side of the aisle to encourage discrimination by faith-based institutions .
