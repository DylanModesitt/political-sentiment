mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
so , in other words , if one desecrates a flag to make a nice point , that is a good context . 
if they desecrate it to make an unpopular point , that should be jailable . 
i thank the gentleman from indiana ( mr. sodrel ) xz4006320 for making my point . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , member of the committee on the judiciary .
