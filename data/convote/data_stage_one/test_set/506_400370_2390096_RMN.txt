mr. chairman , i rise in support of the miller-boehlert substitute amendment because i believe we will not have a world to live in if we continue our neglectful ways . 
the endangered species act has been a guiding force for the preservation of species threatened with extinction for over 30 years . 
it is vitally important that we not alter it in any way that could result in the protection it provides from being compromised . 
the endangered species act is working . 
according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service , 99 percent of the species ever listed under the esa have been prevented from going extinct , and 68 percent are stable or improving ; but the recovery plans in place may need 50 years to restore these to relative abundance . 
the amendment would prevent the creation of a mandatory entitlement program for private property owners which is likely to be hugely expensive . 
the substitute also restores the role of science in the endangered species act . 
the underlying bill appears to give the opinions of individuals without any scientific expertise equal standing with those of scientists and repeals protections against hazardous pesticides . 
i oppose h.r. 3824 and any efforts to weaken the endangered species act . 
i support the miller-boehlert substitute .
