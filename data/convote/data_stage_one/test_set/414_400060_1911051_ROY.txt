mr. chairman , i want to again thank and recognize the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) , the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 , and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 for bringing this amendment forward . 
i would just like to reiterate and rise in support of this amendment . 
as the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 indicated , this amendment is about stopping terrorists . 
and as we are deliberating on this bill as a whole and the purpose being to do everything we can to stop terrorism , this amendment speaks right to the point . 
as the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 indicated , there are real cases that have been uncovered and have been tried in court in which known terrorist organizations such as hezbollah have been engaged in the illegal trafficking of cigarettes from low tax states into high tax states using that money to fund their terrorist activities . 
that is what this amendment does . 
and as the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 has said , all the modifications make sure that there is no impact on tribal sovereignty . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment .
