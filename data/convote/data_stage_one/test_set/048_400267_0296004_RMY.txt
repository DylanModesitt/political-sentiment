mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 27 and thank the gentleman from ohio for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor , the job training improvement act of 2005 , which i introduced to strengthen and reauthorize the nation 's job training system as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs . 
job training programs must be responsive to the needs of the workforce and improving them is critical . 
in today 's knowledge-based economy , we need to equip americans with the skills they need to find a new or better job and quickly return to the workforce . 
one of the hallmarks of wia is that in order to encourage the development of comprehensive systems that improve services to both employers and job seekers , local services are provided through a one-stop delivery system . 
the one-stop centers serve as the front line in helping job seekers return to the workforce . 
at the one-stop centers , assistance ranges from core services such as job search and placement assistance , access to job listings and an initial assessment of skills and needs , to intensive services such as comprehensive assessments and case management and , if needed , occupational skills training . 
over the last 3 years , i have met with local workforce development leaders , businesses , the administration , researchers , and others to examine how we can improve our federal job training system . 
while the workforce investment act of 1998 made dramatic reforms to the nation 's workforce system , i learned that further refinements were necessary to ensure state and local officials have the flexibility they need to effectively target resources toward the unique needs of their communities . 
the job training improvement act builds upon wia to make it more demand-driven and flexible while reducing unnecessary duplication and inefficiency . 
h.r. 27 will help strengthen and improve the nation 's locally driven , business-led workforce investment system to help states and localities ensure workers get the training they need to find good jobs . 
for example , the bill streamlines the current wia funding in order to provide more efficient and results-oriented services and programs by combining the adult , dislocated , and employment service funding streams into one funding stream . 
this will eliminate duplication in service delivery and administrative functions that remain in the system , improving services for individuals . 
the bill also ensures the financial contribution of the mandatory partners in the one-stop centers while at the same time it increases the service integration among the partner programs . 
this will improve access to services through the one-stop delivery system for special populations , such as individuals with disabilities . 
in order to ensure greater responsiveness to local area needs and strengthen the private sector 's role , the bill simplifies the local and state governance processes . 
one-stop partner programs will no longer be required to have a seat on the local boards . 
this will provide for greater representation and influence by local business representatives . 
currently , they are frequently frustrated that they are not able to connect with or access resources from the local boards . 
mr. chairman , i had a couple of my good friends , constituents in my district , that lost their jobs in the defense industry . 
they came up and thanked me for the help they received from wia . 
they were able to get vouchers . 
one of them went on to become a school teacher , one a worker in the computer industry . 
this bill works . 
the new bill that we are passing today will make it better , more efficient and help the people to really get the services they need so we can continue to have the job growth that we have been enjoying the last few months here in the country . 
i support this strongly .
