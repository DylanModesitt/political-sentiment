mr. speaker , in a few words , this is fiscal madness . 
it is a death wish on the part of some of my colleagues about fiscal responsibility . 
what my colleagues are burying is fiscal responsibility . 
the national debt is now $ 4.6 trillion , $ 6.3 if we add in social security funds . 
as mentioned , this bill would add $ 290 billion in debt , and who would benefit ? 
the very , very wealthy . 
one-third of the estate tax is paid by the wealthiest one of one thousand americans . 
i think that is one-tenth of 1 percent . 
not farmers or small business people . 
that is the lamest argument brought to this floor in recent memory . 
the pomeroy amendment would totally take care of this , and what my majority colleagues ' bill does , and it is interesting , they do not come here and say so , they would increase the taxes for thousands and thousands of americans . 
these citizens would have to pay capital gains tax when they do not now do so . 
why do my colleagues not come here and say this is a tax increase for thousands of americans ? 
they do not say that . 
what this is also , everybody should understand , is a further raid on social security funds . 
my colleagues have come here , some of them on the majority side , talking about social security and how we need to address the shortfall . 
for some of these same colleagues , private accounts do not even touch that , and then they come here and increase the shortfall . 
this is true fiscal madness . 
my colleagues will indulge in it again i guess , and i hope , once again , the senate will come to our rescue .
