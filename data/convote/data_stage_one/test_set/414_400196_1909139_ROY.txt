mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from arizona for yielding me this time , and i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 . 
i have the distinction of being one of the few members on the committee on the judiciary who is not an attorney , and i got a little applause on that , i think . 
but i came to congress from the business of automobile security . 
the one thing i know about what we are dealing with in terrorism is that if you leave an open window on an automobile , no amount of security will protect you . 
if you leave the automobile or your home unlocked , no security system will protect you . 
there is absolutely no doubt that we must protect america . 
to do so , we have to be able to go anywhere and never take anything completely off the table . 
i believe that this amendment allows us to guarantee that there are no safe havens for terrorists while , at the same time , we will protect the privacy and the fair expectation that there will not be unreasonable rifling through the records at libraries or , for that matter , i hope , anywhere else under this act .
