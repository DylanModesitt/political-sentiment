mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time . 
over the past 3 years , the patriot act has played a key role in the prevention of terrorist attacks right here in the united states . 
prior to the patriot act , the ability of government agencies to share information with each other was limited , which kept investigators from fully understanding what terrorists might be planning and to prevent their attacks . 
the u.s. attorney for the northern district of indiana , joseph van bokkelen , explained , `` if an assistant u.s. attorney learned through the use of a grand jury that there was a planned terrorist attack in northern indiana , he or she could not share that information with the cia. '' the patriot act brought down the wall separating intelligence agencies from law enforcement and other entities charged with protecting the nation from terrorism . 
it has given law enforcement the tools they need to investigate terrorist activities while striking a delicate balance between preventing another attack and preserving citizens ' constitutional rights . 
and to date , there has not been one verified case of civil liberties abuse . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization of the patriot act and to give our government the tools it needs to succeed in the war on terrorism .
