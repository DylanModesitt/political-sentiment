mr. chairman , let me say that i think the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 has spotted a loophole in our current law and the vulnerability for aircraft that are not passenger aircraft in nature . 
an aircraft that is brought down by a laser will kill people just as dead if they have passengers on it or if it is a cargo plane or general aviation aircraft or a government plane . 
i think people who shine lasers into cockpits of planes should have to face the music with criminal charges whether the planes are carrying passengers or not , and i think the amendment is a good one and ought to be adopted .
