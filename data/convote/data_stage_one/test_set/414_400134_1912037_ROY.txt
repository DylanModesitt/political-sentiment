mr. speaker , i am probably the last person expected to speak on behalf of the committee or the leadership in general . 
i tend to be critical sometimes of committees and the leadership and the process here . 
but let me tell you , i have watched the process here in the committee on the judiciary over the past couple of years on this issue . 
i have watched us hold hearing after hearing , 12 just in the last several months , 2 in the last congress , and i have watched us adopt amendment after amendment in committee . 
we held a 12-hour markup there , a serious markup . 
i am often critical of the way we do business here , but here i saw it work . 
we did exercise effective oversight . 
mr. speaker , nobody loves sunsets like this arizonan . 
i was very supportive of the sunsets we had in the bill initially . 
i am very supportive of the sunset we have , the 10-year sunsets on the two controversial provisions . 
i think those ought to stand , and i hope they make it through the process . 
but i have learned on issues like this you do not get everything you want . 
i did not get every amendment i wanted . 
i got a few , and a few of the ones we did get were substantive . 
we have made amendments to section 215 , to section 213 . 
we have tightened up the requirements of national security letters . 
these are substantive amendments . 
they are good . 
sometimes , as my hero in politics said once , in one book , barry goldwater said , `` politics is nothing more than public business . 
sometimes you make the best of a mixed bargain . 
you do n't always get everything you want. '' we got good substantive reform here and we have sunsets . 
they are a bit longer than i am comfortable with at times , but we have them here . 
i think we ought to make the best of what we have . 
it is a good product . 
i commend the chairman and the others . 
and i should say it is not just the committee on the judiciary that has gone through this process . 
the permanent select committee on intelligence has had hearings as well . 
they have had a markup process and have worked collaboratively , democrats and republicans . 
my own amendments , virtually every one of them , had democrats on them . 
i have worked with them and we have worked together on this . 
i helped form the patriot act reform caucus over a year ago . 
we have worked to make sure these changes have been made . 
this is a good product . 
i urge a `` no '' vote on the motion to recommit and `` yes '' on the underlying bill .
