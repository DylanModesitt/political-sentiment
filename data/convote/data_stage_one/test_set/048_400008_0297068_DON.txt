mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
mr. chairman , next month my family and i will observe my wife 's jewish tradition and recite the ancient story , the passover at our family seder . 
later this month , i will honor my religious tradition and commemorate christ 's crucifixion on good friday and his resurrection on easter sunday . 
and today i will honor the principles behind the united states constitution and vote for the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 amendment . 
the principle here is that when an organization takes federal money , it takes with it the responsibility not to discriminate . 
i do not think we should ever have a situation in this country where an organization takes taxpayers ' money collected from everyone and then says if they want to be a job counselor in our agency , they can not be a catholic , they can not be jewish , they can not be muslim , they can not be an evangelical christian . 
our religious organizations are free and should remain free to discriminate with their own funds . 
that is the religious liberty that our friends on the other side refer to correctly . 
but that liberty does not extend to the power to use someone else 's money to subsidize the practice of one 's religion . 
that is the establishment of a religion which is specifically precluded by the first amendment of the constitution . 
it would be a travesty to reject the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 amendment . 
it would be wholly consistent with the religious principles of this country to adopt it . 
i would urge its adoption .
