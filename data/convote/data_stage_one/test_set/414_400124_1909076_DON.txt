mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding me this time . 
one of the most prudent things , in my view , that congress did in passing the original patriot act was to sunset certain provisions , thus ensuring that a future congress would review and revise them and have a very healthy and sobering debate . 
rather than sunsetting these provisions again , this bill makes permanent 14 of the 16 provisions set to expire without addressing the important civil liberty issues . 
i am somewhat taken aback as i listen to different parts of the debate on the floor . 
one would think that the constitution is something that can be set aside when it is not convenient to follow . 
the constitution is the soul of our nation . 
there are magnificently written constitutions around the world , but their countries do not heed their constitution . 
the american people take our constitution seriously . 
and so this debate , not allowing the sunsets in the future , i think is very , very important to bring up today . 
the bill continues to allow the fbi to get financial , telephone , internet and consumer records relevant to an intelligence investigation without judicial approval . 
prior to the patriot act , these requests had to be directed at agents of a foreign power . 
under the patriot act , they can be used against anyone , including american citizens . 
the bill continues to allow the fbi to execute a search and seizure warrant without notifying the target of a warrant for 6 months if it is deemed that providing advance notice would interfere with the investigation . 
this section is not limited to terrorism investigations and is not scheduled to sunset . 
the bill does not sufficiently address the issues in section 206 which deal with the roving john doe wiretaps . 
under the patriot act , the fbi can obtain a warrant and intelligence investigations without identifying the person or the phone in question . 
this bill dose nothing to protect library records and bookstore receipts . 
i offered an amendment in the intelligence committee to modify section 215 of the patriot act to prohibit the fbi from using this section to obtain library circulation records , library patron lists , book sales records , or book customer lists , but the amendment was not allowed by the rules committee . 
in conclusion , the american people love and cherish their liberties , and they want and deserve to be safe . 
i think we can do both . 
i do not believe this bill does both . 
we need a better bill .
