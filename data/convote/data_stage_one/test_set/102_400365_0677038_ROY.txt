mr. speaker , i yield myself a minute and a half . 
mr. speaker , once again the opponents of this legislation are not correct . 
my friend , the gentleman from massachusetts , says that someone who is injured in iraq and comes home is not going to be protected from medical expenses . 
the united states government has stood behind everybody who has a service-connected injury or disability and pays for the medical treatment out of taxpayers ' money because that is the right thing to do . 
secondly , he says that this bill continues the millionaires ' exemption in the eight states that have unlimited exemption . 
wrong . 
it plugs that exemption . 
and if this bill goes down , a corporate crook can build a multimillion dollar mansion on the intercostal waterway in florida and be able to shield that asset from bankruptcy . 
what this bill does is it does plug that unlimited exemption and it plugs it in a way that was negotiated out in a bipartisan manner in the conference committee two congresses ago with a motion that was made in that conference committee by my senior senator , herb kohl , who is a democrat . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
