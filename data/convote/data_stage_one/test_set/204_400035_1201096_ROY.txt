mr. speaker , every invention , each new scientific concept , every technical advance in the history of mankind has been challenged and analyzed and debated , and properly so . 
change makes us uncomfortable , forces us to design new paradigms ; but in the final analysis , it is man 's fundamental obligation to use science for the betterment of mankind . 
in this instance , we are called upon to heal diseases that have plagued and bewildered us for centuries . 
it would be unconscionable and irresponsible should we fail to live up to our obligation in this critical matter . 
the moral and ethical question is this , do we destroy embryos , simply discard them , embryos that will never be implanted in a womb but which can advance stem cell research to cure historic illnesses ? 
the answer is , no , we should move forward with important scientific research , forward movement which will be enhanced in a measured way by passage of the measure before us .
