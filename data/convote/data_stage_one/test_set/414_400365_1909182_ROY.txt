mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me , and , mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 . 
one of the things that the bill did in section 215 was to provide a procedure for challenging a section 215 order . 
what this does is it codifies procedures for challenging the receipt of national security letters , and i think that this is a step in the right direction . 
let me say that a national security letter is never issued to the target of an investigation . 
a place where it would be issued would be to get records that are in the custody of someone who may have information relative to the target of the investigation . 
for example , it appears that one of the people who was involved in the london bombing 2 weeks ago studied at the university of north carolina . 
to get the records of this person 's attendance at the university of north carolina would be a subject of a national security letter . 
now , i do not know whether one has been issued or one has not been , but that is an example of the type of information that the nsls are used for . 
this is a good amendment , mr. chairman , and i support it .
