mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the sponsor of the amendment mentioned that hearing we had . 
i would remind him that the hearing was a hearing on habeas corpus , also the same hearing we heard the issue of the question of whether the death penalty deters murder or other crimes , and this bill . 
we were given one witness to cover all of that . 
our witness covered habeas corpus . 
we did not have the opportunity to invite a witness to discuss this bill and the policy implications of death penalty where no death occurs and alternate jury rules , peremptory challenges , the number of jurors needed to impose a death penalty , all of these death penalties involved . 
so to suggest that that was a fair hearing , i think , does not do justice to actually what happened on that day and the consideration of this bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , a member of the committee .
