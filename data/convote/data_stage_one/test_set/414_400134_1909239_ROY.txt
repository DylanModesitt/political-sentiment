mr. chairman , i yield myself the remaining time to conclude briefly , simply to say that the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , mentioned that the amendment represents half a loaf , and i will freely concede that it does . 
rarely do you get an amendment to a bill that represents the full loaf . 
but i should point out that in committee we considered another half-a-loaf amendment , if you will , to section 213 ; and that amendment by myself and the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 clarified or , not clarified , but actually put in some false stops with regard to delayed notification searches where you have to appear before a judge after 80 days to justify delayed notifications . 
after 90-day increments beyond that time , you have to appear again and justify that search as well . 
that is the other half a loaf . 
we have also had many other amendments in committee , and here on the floor , that could be considered half a loaf . 
with that , i think we got a pretty good product in the end , and that is what we are seeking to have here . 
i would urge support of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
