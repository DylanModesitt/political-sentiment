mr. speaker , the issue of embryonic stem cell research places humanity on the frontier of medical science and at the outer edge of moral theology . 
on the side of science there is much hope , even expectation that extraordinarily effective therapies will be developed due to a wide range of maladies from diabetes to parkinson 's , spinal cord injury and a host of others . 
progress has been achieved in the laboratory in animal studies and in human application . 
much has yet to be learned , however , about adverse outcomes , which is why scientists proceed cautiously without overpromising and with respect for moral considerations of their research . 
the latter gives me the greatest pause . 
an editorial in america magazine said it well : `` the debate over embryonic stem cell research can not be fully resolved because it is ignited by irreconcilable views of what reverence for life requires. '' let us recall louise brown , the first test tube baby . 
her life began as a single cell , fertilized egg , in vitro . 
there are many leftover potential louise browns , potential human beings as cryogenic embryos conceived in the laboratory . 
are they to be discarded or , can they be ethically used for stem cell research ? 
that is the moral theology issue that we must resolve . 
i can not get over the reality that human life is created in creating an embryo , whether in vitro or whether in utero . 
each of us has to decide the morality of this unique aspect of the issue . 
but i can not get over the moral theology underpinning of this extraordinary research on the frontier of science that we are tinkering with human life . 
and we must not tinker further . 
we know not where we head . 
it is between god and us . 
let us resolve any uncertainty in favor of life .
