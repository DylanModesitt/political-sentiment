mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the gentleman 's amendment and yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the amendment that is being offered by my friend , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. kildee ) xz4002160 , would strike all of the positive reforms for youth that are included in h.r. 27 . 
under current law , funds for the wia youth program are spread too thinly , as they fund programs that both serve in-school and out-of-school youth . 
in the white house , the disadvantaged youth task force has proposed targeted federal youth training funds to serve the most in need and to reduce the duplication of services amongst federal programs . 
there are a large number of programs today designed to deal with in-school , at-risk children , and there is really only one program in wia that is targeted at out-of-school youth . 
what we tried to do in this bill was to strike a balance by requiring that 70 percent of the youth program funds go to out-of-school youth , a population that is by and large ignored and that i think these funds ought to be targeted to . 
we do allow the local workforce boards to use up to 30 percent of their programs for in-school youth ; but there are other programs , a half a dozen other programs , targeted at these at-risk children who are in school . 
so as a way of trying to bring more synergy to an effort to help out-of-school youth , i think the language we have in the bill strikes the right balance . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
