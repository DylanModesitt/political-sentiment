mr. speaker , i would like to thank the gentlewoman from tennessee . 
talking about being well spoken , she certainly is , and i appreciate the way that she is addressing the great things that are beginning to or continuing to happen in the economy . 
the economy is growing . 
one of the things that is not , of course , is social security . 
it continues , as we have been told , to limp along about 1.5 percent , 1.6 percent . 
but the rest of the economy , where a free market is being allowed to thrive and grow , is helping to create jobs . 
now , there are problems . 
we have not conquered them all . 
but what a great time of hope . 
and i have seen it , and you have expressed it , and you feel it in east texas . 
there is an industry that is looking at reopening a plant in lufkin , texas . 
that is exciting , maybe bringing 4 or 500 jobs , plus maybe several hundred more potentially once that occurs . 
there is excitement as people think about the potential for helping with tort reform . 
we were having hearings a couple of weeks ago and finding that one of the drains on the medical economy is the fact that 70 percent of all the massive number of physicians who are sued are dropped without any finding of fault and without paying anything in settlement . 
well , that is an area we are working on to help reform , to help eliminate ; 70 percent of the physicians that are sued having to be sued and providing a carrot and a stick to correct that form where abuse has occurred . 
you know , 9/11 should have sent this economy into depression . 
students of history , and i was talking with some students and teachers from grace high school in tyler , texas , and they have been studying a number of aspects of this . 
but we should have gone into a full scale depression . 
but we had a president with courage and with vision . 
and despite what the naysayers were coming out with , he stood firm . 
we had tax cuts . 
and as we found , as president kennedy knew , as president reagan established , every time there has been a tax cut , it has helped the economy . 
thank god for president bush and his standing there firm for tax cuts . 
and we have seen the economy continue to grow . 
as the students i talked with earlier from grace high school had studied , the free market system works . 
you know the pilgrims , as you probably know , congresswoman , they tried a communist form of government . 
and what they found was that it did not work . 
they nearly starved to death . 
so they had to institute free market forces and just , if you do not work you do not eat . 
and the next thing you know , they are thriving , crops are growing , things are going well again . 
and i tell you , we have put way too much trust in government . 
and i am excited about the potential this government has and to be a part of this congress with you because i think we have more potential to get this country on the right road than any congress since the 1930 new deal congress . 
we can establish free market . 
we can fix social security so young people today can have the benefits of the free market economy instead of struggling in poverty with what little bit social security pays . 
this president , this house , this senate have such potential and i consider it an honor to be part of it . 
as it says above the speaker 's head , `` in god we trust. '' and we need to make use of the trust that god has given us . 
and i thank you for the trust with some of your time .
