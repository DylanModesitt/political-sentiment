mr. speaker , to my distinguished colleague from utah for whom i have great respect , i point out that the infield for the cleveland indians has improved significantly since his reference . 
in fact , at shortstop they have a very able player , and they are hot in the middle of a pennant race . 
that assurance to the gentleman is very important , as is this assurance : both bills offer landowners technical assistance , but it is only the bipartisan substitute that allows the secretary to give priority to smaller landowners who can not afford expensive consultants . 
having said that , i rise in strong support of the rule and in strong opposition to the base bill which we hope with a substitute , the bipartisan substitute , to improve substantially and make it a product worthy of the support of the entire house . 
but , frankly , we should not be having this debate today . 
the current version of the bill was not available until monday afternoon . 
everyone concerned with endangered species both inside and outside of government has been scrambling to understand what is h.r. 3824 . 
the congressional research service , a bunch of outside groups that we look to for some advice and counseling , they are scrambling . 
there has not been enough time for members to fully digest the bill or work out any differences . 
i do not think that it should go forward in this manner . 
there is no reason for this rush except to limit discussion and maybe confuse us as we try to understand the full implications . 
the other body is not exactly about to rush to judgment with a measure on the floor . 
we should not be dealing with the most fundamental rewrite of an environmental statute in 15 years in this manner . 
there are so many areas of agreement that we have , let us find common ground . 
i urge opposition to the base bill and strong support for the bipartisan substitute amendment .
