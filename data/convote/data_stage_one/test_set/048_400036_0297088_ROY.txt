mr. speaker , let us tell the truth about what has happened in job creation in america . 
over the last 17 months , 2.7 million new jobs have been created in america . 
our economy is strong and our economy is getting stronger . 
if we look at the underlying bill that we have before us , veterans have a preference to services above all others . 
what the gentleman from michigan proposes here is a brand new program similar to a trade adjustment program that provides up to 2 years of unemployment-type benefits and provides unlimited access to training . 
but the fact is that unemployed workers have access today , people coming back from iraq who are unemployed have access to services , and those who may have their jobs lost through outsourcing have , in fact , access to services . 
but what also happens under the gentleman 's amendment is that they get a preference in this bill . 
the gentleman creates a new preference here above other types of people who may have lost their jobs . 
the underlying bill , in fact , will provide more services to more unemployed workers and workers who want to increase their skills who may not be unemployed . 
but when we look at this , this is a new program . 
this is an authorization . 
there is no appropriation . 
we all know it will probably take 2 to 5 years for this type of program to be implemented . 
the fact is i think it is a cruel hoax on those who may be unemployed , who may fall into one of these categories to think that they are going to be eligible for unemployment-type assistance or be eligible for unlimited training when , in fact , there is no appropriation and the fact is the program will take years to implement . 
i urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to recommit and support the underlying bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
