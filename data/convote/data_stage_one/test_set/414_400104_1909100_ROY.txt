mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the reauthorization and extension of the usa patriot act , the provisions of which have protected the american people and our soil from terrorism since their enactment 4 years ago . 
the patriot act has been instrumental to our prosecution of the war on terror since 9/11 , and , specifically , instrumental to the prosecution of terrorists who have threatened our homeland . 
our law enforcement and intelligence communities have vigorously and appropriately used the patriot act to investigate , charge , and prosecute terrorists . 
five terrorist cells in buffalo , detroit , seattle , portland , and northern virginia have been disbanded . 
terrorists around the world have been brought to justice . 
the notorious wall between law enforcement and intelligence gathering organizations has been broken down . 
prosecutors and investigators have been given more tools to go after terrorists without the outdated redtape that , prior to 9/11 , always hamstrung such efforts . 
loopholes have been closed , safe-havens have been shut , and the war in being won . 
meanwhile , civil liberties are being protected . 
opponents of the patriot act suggest that we have an either/or choice when it comes to safety and civil liberties , but the patriot act -- the ultimate legislative boogey-man for conspiracy theorists -- has worked exactly as the american people were told it would be . 
to date , 4 years after big brother supposedly imposed this draconian usurpation of liberty on the american people , no one has suggested a single instance of a single person 's civil liberties being violated . 
this point bears repeating : on one , not the justice department , not the aclu , not even moveon.org has produced evidence of a single , verifiable patriot act civil liberties abuse . 
it just has n't happened . 
neither has the government 's abuse of the patriot act 's `` delayed notification search warrants , '' which since the act 's passage have comprised fewer than 2 of every 1 , 000 search warrants sought by the justice department . 
the usa patriot act , then , mr. speaker , has been a boon to the law enforcement and intelligence community , a crushing blow to our terrorist enemies -- 212 more of whom , i repeat , are now behind bars -- and a protector of security and freedom to the american people . 
of course , this law should be re-examined . 
that 's why we 've subjected it to such vigorous scrutiny : six inspector general reports ; 12 committee hearings , just since this april ; 41 witnesses , 15 of whom were called by the democrats ; 43 proposed amendments in committee , 8 of which were approved . 
the american people have had ample opportunity to witness the patriot act in action , and in the 4 years since its passage , our nation has been safer , our civil liberties more secure than ever , and our enemies have been hunted , caught , and prosecuted . 
we are winning the war on terror , and the patriot act is a big reason why . 
i urge all members to protect the american people , protect civil liberties , and extend the patriot act .
