mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the bipartisan substitute . 
mr. chairman , the endangered species act is one of our most farsighted and important conservation laws . 
for more than 30 years , the endangered species act has sounded the alarm and saved wildlife that we humans have driven toward extinction . 
today , we have wolves in yellowstone , manatees in florida , and sea otters in california , largely because of the act . 
in the southern part of new jersey , we have bald eagles , timber rattlesnakes , and barred owls because of the protections provided by the endangered species act ; and by protecting their habitat , we have protected our own habitat . 
i am concerned that the provisions contained in h.r. 3824 would profoundly alter the act and the process . 
it contains costly , highly problematic , vague new procedures and ill-conceived tradeoffs that will undermine our ability to conserve fish and wildlife for future generations . 
consequently , i join with my colleagues to offer the responsible , bipartisan miller-boehlert substitute that reforms the law , answers the concerns of landowners , states , and sportsmen while improving the ability to achieve timely recovery of threatened and endangered fish , wildlife , and plants . 
our amendment provides a creative , workable solution that promises better results for recovering endangered species and reducing burdens on landowners . 
the most important tool needed to halt the decline and recover threatened and endangered species is effective habitat protection . 
h.r. 3824 fails to protect habitat . 
the bipartisan amendment has strong provisions to do that . 
by contrast , our substitute provides a better way of protecting habitat necessary for recovery , with a true focus on recovering species . 
there is broad consensus in congress to reform the endangered species act , mr. chairman ; but it is vital that in doing so we maintain the integrity of the act and our ability to conserve these species for future generations . 
the miller-boehlert amendment will do just that , and i urge my colleagues to support the substitute .
