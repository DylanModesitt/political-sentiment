mr. chairman , i just want to make the simple point that the amendment that was offered that was not made in order by myself , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , and the gentleman from california ( mr. berman ) xz4000250 would not have allowed , under any circumstances , a safe haven anywhere for terrorists . 
it was a different approach . 
the standards were higher . 
i think that is an important point to make as a matter of record .
