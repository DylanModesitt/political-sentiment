mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment on two grounds . 
first , i think it moves us in the right direction . 
i have said several times on this floor today about the patriot act that we should mend it , not end it . 
this does tighten section 215 , which has probably been , more than any other section in the patriot act , the subject of intense worry for outside groups and especially those who use libraries . 
but , second , i support it because of the process involved . 
the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 have worked on a bipartisan basis to craft something they could both support and to persuade the leadership of the committee on the judiciary and the committee on rules to embrace it . 
this is what we should see more of , and i wish we were seeing more of it in connection with this bill . 
finally , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 does make important points . 
there is an even better way to amend section 215 , and that way has just been embraced unanimously , obviously on a bipartisan basis , by the senate committee on the judiciary , and that is to connect section 215 orders to specific facts which show the target is connected to an agent of a foreign power . 
that would be best ; and , hopefully , we will get there before this bill becomes law .
