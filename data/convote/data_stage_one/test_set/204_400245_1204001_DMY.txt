mr. speaker , i support h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act . 
stem cell research holds the potential to improve the lives of millions of americans suffering from diseases like cancer , heart disease , and diabetes . 
i believe we should do all we can to support this research , and it is why i am so frustrated at the bush administration 's attempts to stop it . 
nih said that u.s. scientists are falling behind because of the bush 2001 limitations on stem cell research . 
elizabeth nable of the national heart , lung and blood institute said , `` because u.s. researchers who depend on federal funds lack access to newer human embryonic stem cell lines , they are at a technological disadvantage relative to researchers funded by california , as well as investigators in asia and europe . 
my home state of california has already moved ahead of the federal government by establishing the institute for regenerative medicine , which will devote $ 3 billion to embryonic stem cell research over the next 10 years . 
this bill is a modest proposal compared to california 's , but it is still an important step ; and that is why it is supported by all the major educational research institutions in california . 
i include their letter of support in the record . 
let us not drive this research overseas . 
may 19 , 2005 . 
dear representative lofgren : we are writing to express our support for changing federal policy on human embryonic stem cell research to allow an expansion in available cell lines . 
as you probably know , a vote on legislation that would alter current policy is expected in the coming weeks , and we urge your `'yes '' vote . 
embryonic stem cells hold the potential for new cures and therapies for an array of life-threatening diseases affecting millions of americans across the nation . 
this potential will be enhanced by the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act ( h.r. 810 ) , introduced by representatives michael castle ( r-de ) and diana degette ( d-co ) and co-sponsored by more than 200 members of the house of representatives . 
the castle-degette bill would expand current policy to allow federal funding for research with stem cell lines discovered after the mandated august 9 , 2001 , cut-off date as well as lines derived in the future . 
with regard to future stem cell lines , the bill applies only to lines derived from days-old blastocysts that otherwise would be discarded from in vitro fertilization clinics , but that instead are voluntarily donated to research by consenting individuals , without compensation . 
further , this legislation would ensure the development of ethical guidelines for research with embryonic stem cell lines . 
california has moved ahead by establishing the institute for regenerative medicine , which will devote $ 3 billion to embryonic stem cell research over the next ten years . 
the provisions within h.r. 810 are more restrictive than those of the california initiative ; however , h.r. 810 is crucial because it will make a significant difference to nationwide federal research programs . 
this expansion in policy will further facilitate and accelerate the research conducted in our state . 
when the current federal embryonic stem cell research policy went into effect in 2001 , the notion was that 78 cell lines would be available for research . 
currently , only 22 are actually available to researchers ; many others have been found unsuitable . 
furthermore , a number of the available lines are entangled with commercial interests making the cells too expensive or impossible for nih-funded investigators to obtain . 
for these reasons , the existing embryonic stem cell lines do not provide a sufficient supply to advance the research to its full potential . 
embryonic stem cells offer the potential to reverse diseases and disabilities experienced by millions of americans . 
stem cell research is still very new . 
thus , we have a collective responsibility -- scientists , university leaders , and government leaders -- to support the exploration of the promising possibilities of both embryonic and adult stem cell research for curing and preventing disease . 
please support scientific advancement and the possibility of new cures by voting `` yes '' on h.r. 810 to expand federal stem cell research policy . 
sincerely , & lt ; center & gt ; robert c. dynes , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , university of california. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; steven b. sample , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , university of southern california. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; david baltimore , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , california institute of technology. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; john l. hennessy , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , stanford university. & lt ; /em & gt ;
