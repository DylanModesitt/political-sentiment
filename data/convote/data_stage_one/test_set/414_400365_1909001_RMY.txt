mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and i rise in strong support of h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
mr. chairman , the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , tragically affirmed the urgency of updating america 's laws to address the clear and present danger presented by international terrorism . 
on that day , foreign terrorists maliciously and without provocation attacked the united states , murdered thousands of our citizens , and destroyed symbols of our freedom in a failed effort to break the spirit and resolve of the american people . 
we must also recall that these terrorists exploited historic divisions between america 's law enforcement and intelligence communities that had limited the dissemination of vital and timely information and increased america 's vulnerability to terrorist attack . 
in the wake of the 9/11 atrocities , broad bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress passed the patriot act that lowered the wall that prohibited our law enforcement and intelligence communities from effectively sharing information , and to enhance investigatory tools necessary to assess , detect , and prevent future terrorist attacks . 
u.s. law enforcement and intelligence authorities have utilized the expanded information sharing provisions contained in the patriot act to gain critical knowledge of the attentions of foreign-based terrorists before they occur , while preempting gathering terrorist threats at home . 
while the patriot act and other anti-terrorism initiatives have helped avert additional attacks on our soil , that threat has not receded . 
exactly 2 weeks ago , innocent citizens in london were murdered in a series of ruthlessly coordinated attacks . 
earlier today , it appears , the london subway system came under renewed attack . 
last year , the madrid bombings brought unprecedented terror to the people of spain , and ongoing terrorist operations around the globe demonstrate the imperative for continued vigilance . 
when the house committee on the judiciary reported the patriot act in october 2001 , i pledged to rigorously examine its implementation and the conduct of the war against terrorism . 
in my words and in my actions as committee chair , i have maintained this commitment and emphasized the importance of better protecting our citizenry from terrorist attack while , at the same time preserving the values and liberties that distinguish us as americans . 
the legislation we consider today reflects this careful balance . 
h.r. 3199 is based upon 4 years of comprehensive bipartisan oversight consisting of hearing testimony , inspector general reports , briefings , and oversight letters . 
since april of this year alone , the committee has received testimony from 35 witnesses during 12 hearings on the patriot act . 
this extensive hearing and oversight record has demonstrated that the patriot act has been an effective tool against terrorists and other criminals . 
of no less importance , and notwithstanding the vague and general suspicion expressed by some of its detractors , the record shows that there is no evidence whatsoever that the patriot act has been abused to violate americans ' civil liberties . 
none whatsoever . 
to further allay concerns expressed by some , this bill makes important revisions to section 215 of the patriot act , which pertains to business records obtained through the foreign intelligence surveillance act , or fisa . 
i would note that section 215 is probably the most misunderstood and deliberately misrepresented provision of the patriot act . 
h.r. 3199 clarifies that the information likely to be obtained through a fisa warrant must relate to foreign intelligence information not concerning a u.s. person , or must be information pertaining to an ongoing international terrorism investigation or clandestine intelligence activities . 
the legislation also explicitly clarifies that a section 215 order will issue only `` if the judge finds that the requirements have been met , '' and provides the committee on the judiciary last week conducted a nearly 12-hour markup of this legislation , at which 43 amendments were offered and debated . 
the reported version of this legislation extends for 10 years the sunset on sections 206 and 215 of the patriot act . 
section 206 pertains to roving wiretaps under fisa . 
this crucial provision updates the law to reflect contemporary communications technology by making a suspected terrorist , rather than a communications device , the proper target of a wiretap . 
this sunset provision was approved by the committee by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 26 to 2. however , while the legislation sets expiration dates on certain provisions of the patriot act , congressional oversight of the entire patriot act must be perpetual . 
let me conclude with the following point : for too long opponents of the patriot act have transformed it into a grossly distorted caricature that bears no relationship whatsoever to the legislation itself . 
the patriot act has been misused by some as a springboard to launch limitless allegations that are not only unsubstantiated but are false and irresponsible . 
our constituents expect and deserve substantive consideration of this vital issue , and i hope that today 's debate reflects the bipartisan seriousness that this issue demands . 
mr. chairman , the security of the american people is the most solemn responsibility of all entrusted to the congress . 
passage of the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 is vital to maintaining the post-9/11 law enforcement intelligence reforms that have reduced america 's vulnerability to terrorist attack . 
we must never return to the pre- 9/11 mindset that ignores the painful lessons of that day as well as the tragic experiences of our friends and allies . 
i would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this vital legislation . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
