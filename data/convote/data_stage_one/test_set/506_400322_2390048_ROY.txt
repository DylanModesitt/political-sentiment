mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds to say , this is another area where you guys are just not consistent . 
one of you comes down and beats us up because we are spending too much money about this massive increase in spending under this bill . 
somebody else comes down and says , you do not fully fund endangered species under this bill . 
either we spend too much or we do not spend enough . 
you can not have it both ways . 
either we spend too much or we do not spend enough , but you can not keep coming down here and trying to make both arguments .
