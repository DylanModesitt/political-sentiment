mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time . 
i also thank the gentleman from california ( mr. issa ) xz4001960 for this amendment . 
this section of the patriot act authorizes expansive authority for john doe roving wiretaps , taps of phones and computers when neither the location nor the identity of the target are known . 
the issa amendment further improves the amendment that i offered during the intelligence committee markup of the patriot act reauthorization bill . 
my amendment , i am pleased to say , was unanimously accepted by the entire committee and is included in the base bill before the house today . 
the issa amendment appropriately defines the term `` reasonable period for filing return '' as not more than 15 days . 
it assures the foreign intelligence surveillance court , we often call it the fisa court , will receive information related to john doe roving wiretaps in a timely manner by removing any ambiguity associated with the term `` reasonable. '' it makes it clear to every fbi agent , doj lawyer and judge from the start , this is a 15-day limit on providing the court with information related to john doe roving wiretaps . 
this is a good fix to a good provision that further strengthens the amendment to the patriot act . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment . 
i thank the gentleman from california for offering it .
