mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to this amendment . 
just as everyone here today , i view the american flag with a special reverence , and i am deeply offended when people burn or otherwise abuse this precious national symbol . 
at the start of the town hall meeting i host in my district , i always try take a few moments to lead those in attendance in the pledge of allegiance . 
i think this is an important and valuable portion of my town hall meetings when i can express my support for and share my deep respect of both our flag and our system of government-which our flag represents . 
what makes america a great and free society , is our system of government and our constitution . 
our constitution is the document that provides the basis for our great country . 
it is our nation 's operating manual . 
for over two centuries , the constitution -- the greatest invention of humans -- has allowed our diverse people to live together , to balance our various interests , and to thrive . 
it has provided each citizen with broad , basic rights . 
the constitution does n't fly majestically in front of government buildings . 
we do not pledge allegiance to it each day . 
yet , it is the source of our freedom . 
it tells us that we are free to assemble peacefully . 
we are free to petition our government ; we are free to worship without interference ; free from unlawful search and seizure ; and free to choose our leaders . 
it secures the right and means of voting . 
it is these freedoms that define what it is to be an american . 
as a member of congress , i took an oath of office in which i swore `` ... .. 
that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states. '' in fact , new citizens to our great nation make a similar pledge when they are sworn in as u.s. citizens . 
it is important to note that i am entrusted with the obligation to defend the constitution , not the symbols , of our nation . 
the founders knew that it is our system of government that is essential to who were are as a people and what we stand for . 
while i deeply value the flag as a symbol of our nation , what we need to ensure is that we protect the values and ideals of our country as contained within the constitution . 
in its more than 200 years , the constitution has been amended only 27 times . 
with the exception of the eighteenth amendment , which was later repealed , these amendments have reaffirmed and expanded individual freedoms and the specific mechanisms that allow our self-government to function . 
this resolution before us today would not perfect the operation of our self-government . 
it would not expand our citizen 's rights . 
proponents of this constitutional amendment argue that we need to respect our flag . 
i believe that the vast majority of americans already respect our flag , and i am unaware of a flag burning epidemic in america . 
to me this resolution is a solution in search of a problem . 
let me be clear , it is wrong to desecrate or defile an american flag in any way . 
but making it unconstitutional will not prevent these incidents from occurring . 
what we should do , as a government and as american citizens , is promote civic values and a greater understanding of our democracy . 
we should encourage civic education in our schools and communities . 
people who value and understand the ideals of our country will also understand and value the symbols of our great nation . 
the issue before us is whether our constitution should be amended so that the federal government can prosecute the handful of americans who show disrespect for the flag . 
to quote james madison , is this a `` great and extraordinary occasion '' justifying the use of a constitutional amendment ? 
the answer is no ; this is not such an occasion . 
i oppose this amendment because i believe that while attempting to preserve the symbol of the freedoms we enjoy in this country , it actually would harm the values and ideals that created of these freedoms .
