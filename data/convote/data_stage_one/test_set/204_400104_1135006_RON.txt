i would anticipate the same types of amendments being allowed that has been sort of tradition around here on the dod authorization bill . 
the rules committee did make an announcement tonight about filing amendments in a timely fashion . 
most of the amendments would be considered by the rules committee , but obviously it is too early to tell what the rules committee will finally do .
