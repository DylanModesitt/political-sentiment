mr. speaker , my motion to recommit is simple . 
it provides extra assistance to workers whose jobs have been outsourced and veterans who are returning from conflicts overseas . 
mr. speaker , half a million jobs have been outsourced over the past 3 years . 
an additional 830 , 000 jobs are expected to be outsourced in 2005 and 3.3 million by 2015 . 
up to 6 million jobs may be sent overseas in the next 10 years . 
these statistics represent lost jobs for american workers . 
fewer jobs means that american workers will struggle to provide for their families and fall further into debt . 
the administration has turned a deaf ear to the needs of these workers . 
american workers who lose their jobs due to outsourcing need significant assistance and resources to obtain new employment . 
this motion would provide this help . 
likewise , many veterans returning from the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq may need skills and training to obtain or retain their jobs . 
reservists who have spent a year or more overseas have put their careers on hold to serve our country . 
this amendment would provide the help they need . 
mr. speaker , i urge members who want to help our veterans and those who have lost their jobs to outsourcing to support this motion . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from south dakota ( ms. herseth ) xz4004430 .
