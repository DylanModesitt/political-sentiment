mr. speaker , in missouri 's 5th district there are two individuals , jim and virginia stowers , who did not seek a federal grant , but who used $ 2 billion of their own money to begin some very vital research . 
they founded the stowers institute . 
and the stowers institute employs brilliant researchers from more than 20 countries around the world , and they are working with the most advanced tools to answer the questions and build the bridges between diseases and cures . 
our nation is blessed with the greatest minds and researchers on this planet . 
but to whom much is given , much is required . 
and so , mr. speaker , this nation has a wonderful opportunity right now to respond to the needs and the interests of its people . 
two boys , twin boys were in bed . 
one fell out of the bed in the middle of the morning , and when the parents went in to see him and asked what happened , he said , as he looked up to the bed , i think i was sleeping too close to where i got in . 
and that is where we are , mr. speaker . 
even after the president has spoken , we are , as a nation , still sleeping too close to where we got in with regard to research on stem cells .
