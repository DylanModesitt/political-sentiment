mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule , but before i speak on the rule itself , let me say to our friends in great britain , one of our strongest allies in the fight against terrorism , we are with you . 
we empathize with the pain that has been visited upon you once again . 
we are in this fight against terrorists together . 
everybody on this floor views themselves and acts as a patriot on behalf of america , its values , and its people . 
all 435 members of this house . 
they will see things differently as we consider this bill , but they are all 100 percent committed to defeating terrorism , to ferreting out terrorists , to getting them off our streets , out of our country and incarcerated , as they should be . 
make no mistake about the commonality of that commitment . 
i know that the members of this house on both sides of the aisle are united in that commitment . 
today , on this house floor the american people will see no division in our willingness to do what is necessary to fight terrorism . 
what they will see today , however , mr. speaker , is an abuse of power by the republican majority , which has deliberately and purposefully chosen to stifle a full debate on this critical legislation . 
i voted for the patriot act . 
i think we need to reauthorize the sections involved , but we ought to look at them carefully . 
a republican rule that has been offered today is nothing less , and i use my words carefully , than a craven failure of our congressional oversight responsibility on legislation that involves the government 's power to intrude on the lives of americans . 
we must protect americans , we must confront terrorists , but we must also ensure our constitutional values . 
every single year , mr. speaker , this congress reauthorizes the department of defense programs . 
this reauthorization process allows us to assess , reexamine , and to recalibrate our defense policies to changing circumstances . 
today , however , we are being asked to give up that oversight responsibility and permanently authorize many sections of this bill . 
now , let me make it clear to the public that the overwhelming majority of the patriot act is in law right now and will not be affected by this legislation . 
sixteen sections only are the subject of this legislation . 
we are being asked to extend two provisions , particularly one that involves roving wiretaps , and the other dealing with the fbi 's power to demand business records for 10 years . 
democrats have suggested we ought to sunset these provisions . 
why are you afraid to have a vote on the floor of the house of representatives on that provision ? 
why are you fearful ? 
why do you fear the democratic process ? 
i do not know . 
the sanders amendment . 
you failed to offer that , yet 238 members of this house , just days ago , voted for that provision . 
why are you afraid to have another vote on the floor ? 
are you afraid you can not get your members to change their minds ? 
are you afraid of the democratic process in this , the people 's house ? 
do you undermine that democracy which we confront terrorists for doing ? 
my friends , this rule is not consistent with the open democratic process in adopting one of the most important bills that we will consider . 
i agree with the gentleman from california . 
that is why i voted for the patriot act , to give law enforcement the capability and assurance we could confront and catch terrorists and protect americans in our country , but we should have come with a better rule . 
it is lamentable that we did not .
