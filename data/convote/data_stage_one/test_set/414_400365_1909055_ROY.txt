mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 1/2 minutes to rebut my good friend from california . 
mr. chairman , effective oversight is a function of effective congressional leadership and not as a result of legislative sunsets . 
if we restricted oversight to legislative sunsets , only about 5 percent of the laws that we pass are sunset , and most of those are appropriations bills . 
now , the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 is the chairman of an oversight subcommittee on the committee on international relations . 
i do not see any sunsets coming on bills coming out of the committee on international relations because i have faith in the gentleman from california 's ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 being able to do effective oversight . 
the committee on the judiciary has done a huge amount of oversight . 
we have had extensive hearings . 
there has been more process and more hearings and more witnesses on more sides of the issue on the patriot act than practically any other piece of legislation that i have faced in my 26-plus years as a member of congress . 
thirty-five witnesses , 12 hearings , oversight letters , responses , inspectors general reports . 
i wish i had brought all of the paper that has come about as a result of the committee on the judiciary 's oversight , because it would stack this high off the table here in the house chamber . 
mr. chairman , the following is a listing of the oversight activities so that the american public and everybody can see that this committee has done its job . 
it has done its job effectively , and it has made sure that the civil liberties of the people of this country have not been infringed upon .
