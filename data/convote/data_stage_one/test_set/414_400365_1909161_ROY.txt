mr. chairman , i am pleased to support the gentlewoman 's amendment and believe that it is an important consolidation in the criminal law relative to attacks against mass transportation systems . 
first , we should not have different crimes and different penalties depending upon which type of mass transportation system is attacked . 
we should have uniform penalties and uniform definitions of criminal activity so someone who attacks a railroad will get the same penalty as someone would in a similar attack against a subway system or a bus or an airplane . 
secondly , i think we have to broaden the definition of what is `` attacked '' to make sure that attacks against support systems for mass transportation systems are treated the same way as an attack against the transportation system itself . 
we should not have a lesser penalty if you put a bomb in the station than if you blow up a train while it is crossing a bridge over a big gorge . 
and i also think we ought to ensure that terrorists who attack these systems are punished with appropriate severity . 
the gentlewoman 's amendment does all of these things , and i would urge its support and unanimous adoption by the house .
