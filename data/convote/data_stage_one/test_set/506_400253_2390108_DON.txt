mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the boehlert-miller substitute and against the underlying bill . 
a major factor forcing threatened and endangered species towards extinction is the loss and deterioration of habitat necessary for survival . 
we can not expect a species to recover without first ensuring that it has the habitat in which to do so . 
the majority has just presented us with this manager 's amendment to the underlying bill that would delete not only the protections and enforceability afforded under the designation of critical habitat but also the broader habitat protection provided by the jeopardy definition . 
we have arrived at a situation where the underlying bill will offer no enforceable protection for the habitat that endangered species need to survive , but will only create a blizzard of unenforceable bureaucratic paperwork which , in the words of shakespeare , would be `` full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. '' the boehlert-miller substitute would retain the enforceable protections for habitat provided under a strong jeopardy definition and i urge its adoption .
