mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , this amendment emphasizes a point that we are trying to do this on the floor without a mark-up , and it may have many unintended consequences . 
despite the name of the title , the title of the amendment is `` combating terrorism financing act of 2005 , '' but if you read the provisions , it is not limited to terrorism financing but for all violations of economic sanctions imposed under the international emergency economic powers act . 
i mean , a senior citizen who has traveled to cuba on a bicycle excursion or a clergy attempting to send humanitarian services or supplies to cuba could get caught up in this . 
it talks about misuse of social security numbers so if somebody misuses a social security number to get a job , having nothing to do with terrorism , just is cheating to get a job , they could get caught up in this . 
it raises questions about sending money to your relatives back home . 
all of this is implicated in this amendment . 
it obviously covers terrorism , but we do not know what else it covers . 
people who get caught up in this are looking at 20-year sentences . 
money-laundering statutes are already very broadly written , and this just broadens it even further . 
i would hope we would defeat the amendment so we could have some time to make sure it could be limited to terrorism financing and just not every violation of the international emergency economic powers act and other kinds of money-laundering statutes . 
we also have had not an opportunity to hear from people that may be involved in this , organizations helping immigrant populations , banks or other agencies that may have an interest in this who we just have not had time to hear from to know what their reaction would be . 
so i would hope that we would defeat the amendment so we could have more time to consider it . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 .
