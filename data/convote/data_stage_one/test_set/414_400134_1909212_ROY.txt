mr. chairman , i have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from new york . 
i tend not to be as concerned as he is at this point . 
i share many of his concerns about the overall patriot act , and we have worked to put many of the amendments in place to put ourselves at rest . 
i thank him for his involvement . 
we have had great involvement from both sides of the aisle here . 
these amendments that i am offering today , virtually all of them , are offered with democrat support and cosponsorship . 
my name is not even at the top of some of them . 
we have had good cooperation . 
i feel good about this amendment , about the protection we have offered here , and also to ensure that in cases where it is needed , we offer additional tools for compliance with these requests as well . 
i am pleased with the amendment . 
i urge my colleagues to support it .
