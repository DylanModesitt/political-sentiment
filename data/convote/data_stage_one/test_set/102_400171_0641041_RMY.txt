mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , this is not the first time that this body has addressed the issue of repealing or making permanent the death tax . 
in the 106th congress , on a bipartisan basis , with 279 votes in favor , this body voted in favor of permanently eliminating the death tax . 
and the other body , also on a bipartisan basis , they , too , voted to permanently eliminate the death tax , but president clinton vetoed that bill . 
in the 107th congress , again on a bipartisan basis , the house voted to eliminate the death tax permanently . 
unfortunately , in the reconciliation of trying to put the differences between the two houses together , we put the date of the 2011 when that would expire . 
in the last congress , once again the house addressed this issue and voted to permanently eliminate this death tax . 
the bill that we will address when we pass this rule is exactly the same as the bill that we passed on a bipartisan basis in the last congress . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to vote for the rule and the underlying bill . 
the material previously referred to by mr. mcgovern xz4002630 is as follows : amendment to h. res. 202 offered by rep . 
mcgovern at the end of the resolution , add the following : sec . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution , the amendment made in order under the first section of this resolution shall be modified by adding at the end the following new section : section __ . 
transfers to social security. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) findings. -- congress hereby finds that -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 1 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 290 billion over the 10-year budget window , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 2 ) this $ 290 billion understates the long-term cost of repeal -- in the last year of the budget window repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 70 billion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 3 ) in the next decade , the cost of repealing the estate tax together with the increased interest cost to the united states would be substantially above $ 1 trillion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 4 ) the enormous cost of repealing the estate tax would only benefit the wealthiest 0.3 percent of all families in the united states , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 5 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax would result in a substantial reduction in income tax receipts , and could result in lower receipts in the social security trust funds because of that tax avoidance , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 6 ) the provisions of this act would prevent the reduction in social security receipts that could result from permanent repeal and it would preserve funds necessary to meet commitments made to the social security system or other programs , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 7 ) the provisions of this act provide immediate and substantial estate tax relief , exempting 99.7 percent of all estates from the estate tax , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 8 ) the united states is faced with many other fiscal challenges , including the requirement to meet the commitments made through the social security system , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 9 ) the amounts saved by enacting this act as compared to permanent repeal -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) in the long run on an annual basis would equal the current costs of the operations in iraq , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) could be used for improvements in veterans benefits , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( c ) would close half of the shortfall faced by the social security system. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) transfers to social security. -- section 201 of the social security act ( 42 u.s.c . 
401 ) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( o ) for purposes of ensuring that amounts are available to meet the commitments of the social security system , the secretary of the treasury shall , from time to time , transfer from the general fund in the treasury to the federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund , the savings from the enactment of the certain and immediate estate tax relief act of 2005 as compared to the permanent repeal of the estate tax by the bill h.r. 8 ( as introduced in the 109th congress ) as follows : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 1 ) for fiscal years 2010-2015 , the transfers in each year shall total for each fiscal year specified in the following table , the amount specified in connection with such fiscal year , as follows : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; amount & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` fiscal year : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; transferred : & lt ; center & gt ; 2010 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 6.1 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 3011 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 35.4 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2012 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 39.4 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2013 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 42.7 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2014 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 47.9 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2015 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 50.5 billion .
