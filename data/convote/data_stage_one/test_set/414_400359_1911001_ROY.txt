reserving the right to object , mr. chairman , i am in strong opposition to the underlying amendment , and i also have great concerns about the unanimous consent request . 
mr. chairman , i believe the unanimous consent request is designed to make minimal changes in the underlying amendment . 
i also believe that the unanimous consent request is designed to make the bill less objectionable to some members and thereby encourage them to vote for it . 
i am so opposed to the underlying amendment that i am therefore opposed to the unanimous consent request .
