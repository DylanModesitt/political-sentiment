madam speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 3199 , the patriot act reauthorization conference report . 
this is a balanced reauthorization -- protecting civil liberties and extending the necessary provisions to help us fight the war on terror here at home . 
i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for including a number of provisions from h.r. 3007 combating terrorism financing act . 
funding is the lifeblood of terrorist organizations -- if we are to prevent future attacks and continue to dismantle terrorist organizations we must deny them funding . 
terrorist analysts often note that it is fairly inexpensive to carry out a single act of terror -- for example , it is estimated that the attack on the world trade center cost only $ 500 , 000 . 
terrorist organizations need money not just to carry out such attacks ; they also need funding to continue their operations such as recruiting and training new members and support their current members . 
one of the most important lessons we have learned is exactly how terrorists and other criminal organizations transmit money through unregulated financial markets . 
like the patchwork of terrorist organizations and cells , terrorism funding does not come from a single source . 
terrorist networks are funded through state sponsorship , charities and businesses fronting as legitimate institutions , and exploitation of markets and financial networks . 
the tough terrorism financing language in the conference report will increase penalties for terrorism financing . 
in addition , the bill will add new predicate money laundering offenses to allow law enforcement to investigate and dismantle terrorist financing organizations . 
finally , the original patriot act added a new forfeiture provision for individuals planning or perpetrating an act of terrorism against the united states . 
the language in the conference report adds a parallel provision for individuals planning or perpetrating an act of terrorism against a foreign state or international organizations acting within the jurisdiction of the united states . 
the language in the conference report builds on our current laws , to address some of the shortfalls that we have learned about since september 11 . 
terrorists work to find the holes in our laws and we must make sure that we continue to be diligent to update them so that we can cut off terrorist funds and stop future attacks against us and our allies in the war on terror .
