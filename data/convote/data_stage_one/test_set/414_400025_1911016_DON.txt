mr. chairman , i yield myself 15 seconds . 
the cynicism sometimes stuns me . 
i offered an amendment to ensure that sources and methods only go to the permanent select committee on intelligence , and a member of the committee on armed services objects , and then the chairman says we are not protecting sources and methods so he has to oppose it . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
