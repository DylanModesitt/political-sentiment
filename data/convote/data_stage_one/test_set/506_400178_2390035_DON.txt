mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
the interesting thing about the manager 's amendment is that it takes a very bad bill and makes it even worse . 
i just want to focus on one aspect of this legislation which i think would be amusing in some sense if it were not for the fact that it is an example of a kind of cynical hypocrisy in those people who call themselves fiscally conservative . 
the bill guts the endangered species act , there is no question about that , and all the protections that are involved there ; but then it creates a whole new government giveaway program for some of the nation 's richest landowners and property owners . 
what this bill does is add insult to injury . 
if you think that you are a responsible fiscal conservative , if you do not want to create a big new government giveaway program , then you should be adamantly opposed to this legislation . 
you might want to even cast aside the environmental aspects of it , because if you look at the monetary implications of this and the budgetary implications of this bill , it is going to create an even bigger budget deficit in the context of this huge giveaway program . 
people are using here more and more frequently the devastating impact of the two hurricanes . 
they want to sell off the national parks , they want to remove the safety net for millions of americans who rely upon government services , and now they are going to make it even more difficult for this congress to provide the kind of programs and assistance that are needed in terms of health care , education , a variety of things by passing a piece of legislation that builds an even bigger budget deficit by creating a whole new giveaway program , a new entitlement program for some of the wealthiest people in the country , some of the biggest landowners in the country . 
all they have to do is come here under this legislation , just to ask for it , and it will be given to them . 
if you really want to conserve the fiscal integrity of this process , please vote against this bill .
