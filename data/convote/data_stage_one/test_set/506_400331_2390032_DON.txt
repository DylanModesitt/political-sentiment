mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the manager 's amendment makes significant changes in the bill as it was reported from the committee on resources . 
these changes are likely to result in more species extinctions at greater loss of taxpayer dollars . 
the pending legislation will increase direct spending in the discretionary funding law , which we will get into in general debate , and it could rise to more than $ 600 million a year , $ 235 million more per year than we are spending today for species conservation , according to the congressional budget office . 
let me make one point perfectly clear here : the manager 's amendment is not something i agreed to in my discussions with the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) . 
to say that i agree with 90 percent of this bill is not an accurate description , or is an unfair way to paint the matter . 
one of the points that we had reached agreement on was that there was to be a recovery-based standard of determining when federal agency actions jeopardize the continued existence of a species . 
the manager 's amendment drops this crucial provision . 
it cripples it . 
while i was willing to eliminate critical habitat , it was only on the condition that we ensure that there were adequate provisions in place to encourage recovery . 
without this definition , the bill will not promote recovery . 
we will likely see more endangered and threatened species . 
it is upon that ground that i oppose this manager 's amendment , as well as the loosened compensation standards put in order by the manager 's amendment . 
it eliminates the bill 's requirement that appraisals determining the market value of foregone use of property are binding on both the secretary and the property owner . 
instead , the appraisal is binding only on the secretary , and the property owner may then go to court to seek additional compensation . 
that makes the current pending legislation worse , and it will increase the cost of this entitlement program to property owners and it will increase that cost to the american taxpayer . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maine ( mr. allen ) xz4000070 .
