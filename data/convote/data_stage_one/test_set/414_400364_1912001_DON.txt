mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , this provides mandatory minimums , which we have frequently said if it had come up in committee we would have a letter ready from the judicial conference reminding us that mandatory minimums violate common sense , because if the penalty makes sense , it can be imposed ; if it does not make sense , it has to be imposed anyway . 
this amendment is unnecessarily confusing and duplicative of current law . 
it is already a crime punishable by 20 years in prison , or life in prison in some circumstances , to provide material support of any kind to a terrorist organization or to support a person in carrying out terrorist acts regardless of how the money came about , whether it was from drug proceeds or otherwise . 
if anyone is engaged in drug trafficking of any significance in order to support terrorism , they can already be charged with both a drug offense and the material support of terrorism . 
this might , unfortunately , bring in some small-time dealer that did not know what he was doing and all of a sudden he is subjected to 20-year mandatory minimums when he was not much of a dealer at all . 
this new crime would substantially broaden the federal death penalty in ways that might actually violate the constitution . 
for example , indirect offenses like conspiracy are generally not death eligible , but financing is more analogous to conspiracy than the direct crimes like hijacking , bombing or murder by drug king , which are already death eligible . 
drug trafficking and terrorism crimes already carry numerous penalties for the most egregious offenses , so we do not need them anew in this case . 
mr. chairman , i hope we defeat this amendment . 
we did not put it into the bill in committee when we would have had an opportunity to ensure it did not conflict with various other provisions of the law or was unnecessarily duplicative . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
