mr. chairman , i rise to engage the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) of the committee on education and the workforce in a colloquy . 
during our full committee consideration of h.r. 27 , i offered and withdrew an amendment to ensure that data on high school-aged students participating in adult education programs is publicly available and reported to our committee . 
we already know that 30 percent of our high school students fail to earn diplomas with their peers . 
in the hispanic community , that figure is nearly 50 percent . 
many of our adult education providers report that high school-aged students are flooding their programs . 
we can not continue to allow our high school students to slip through the cracks . 
our first step in shining the light on this issue is to make sure that we have accurate and regularly reported data . 
at full committee , the gentleman offered to work with me to ensure that these concerns are addressed in the reports that our committee received from the department of education .
