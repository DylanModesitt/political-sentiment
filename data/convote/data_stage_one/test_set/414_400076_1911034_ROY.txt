mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment to reduce crime and terrorism at america 's seaports . 
this amendment is long overdue and reflects the hard work and dedication of my colleagues , the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. forbes ) xz4001370 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. stearns ) xz4003880 to an issue of critical importance to our nation 's safety . 
i want to thank all of them for their effort to this end . 
the amendment that we are offering today will protect our seaports by controlling access to seaports on sensitive areas , providing additional authority to the coast guard to investigate vessels , prohibiting use of dangerous weapons or explosives on a passenger vessel , protecting coast guard navigational aides on waterways , prohibiting transportation of dangerous materials by potential terrorists , prohibiting destruction or interference with vessels or maritime facilities , increasing penalties for illegal foreign shipments on vessels , increasing penalties for noncompliance with manifest requirements , increasing criminal penalties for stowaways on vessels , and , finally , increasing penalties for bribery of port security authorities and officials . 
these measures are much-needed and long overdue . 
again , i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. forbes ) xz4001370 , and the gentleman from florida ( mr. stearns ) xz4003880 .
