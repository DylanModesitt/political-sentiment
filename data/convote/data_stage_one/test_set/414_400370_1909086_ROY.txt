mr. chairman , the cold war is over and the world is a more dangerous place . 
the strategy that we used to have of containment , react and mutually assured destruction went out the window on 9/11 . 
lord , it probably went out earlier , we just did not get it . 
we need now to be able to detect in order to prevent , and our intelligence community needs the capability and the tools so they can detect and prevent . 
we are not going to be able to harden a subway site , a bus station , a train station . 
we can have more people , dogs , cameras , lights , we can do a lot of things to help , but we can not stop it unless we have the tools . 
we do not want to use the criminal means to go after terrorists because you have to wait until the crime has been committed . 
we want to prevent not a crime from being committed ; we want to prevent a terrorist attack from being committed . 
so give them the tools . 
the patriot act does it . 
we have seen it operate for 4 years . 
it has been amazing how well it has operated . 
when people talk about libraries , why in the world would we want to make a library a free terrorist zone ? 
we allow our forces to go in for a crime in a library . 
why should they not be allowed to go in for a terrorist issue ?
