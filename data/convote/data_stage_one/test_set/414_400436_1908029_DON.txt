mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to and utter disgust with this bill . 
just as a bad movie is often followed by an even worse sequel , so it is with the patriot act . 
patriot ii does nothing to correct the major flaws in the original legislation . 
basic civil liberties continues to be in jeopardy . 
the bill expands police powers , it continues to authorize invasive violations of our medical records , our library borrowing habits and other private affairs . 
patriot ii restricts freedom , instead of expanding it . 
the irony is cruel , mr. speaker . 
in defense of freedom , we are undermining freedom . 
i believe many of my colleagues voted for the original patriot act because of the sunset provisions , because they were assured this was a temporary measure for extraordinary times . 
now , all but two of the sunsets have been stripped from the bill , and those two come only after 10 years . 
so now we know the truth : the patriot act was never intended as an emergency , post-9/11 action ; as a matter of fact , it is not limited to terrorism . 
it appears now that its authors were always interested in a permanent clampdown on civil liberties . 
this bill is constitutional graffiti , mr. speaker . 
patriotism means affirming and celebrating the values that have made america strong for more than 2 centuries . 
legislation that violates several constitutional amendments has no business calling itself the patriot act . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule and the overall bill .
