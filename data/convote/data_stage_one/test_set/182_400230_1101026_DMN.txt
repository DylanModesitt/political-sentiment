mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this restrictive rule which does not make in order several key amendments that could go a long way to enhancing our security efforts and addressing serious vulnerabilities . 
case in point : the cargo security amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 and just spoken of by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 . 
that being said , today we will consider h.r. 1817 , the first ever authorization measure for the department of homeland security . 
i want to congratulate the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , ranking member , for bringing this important bill on the floor . 
i am proud to serve with them on the committee on homeland security . 
while it is not as far reaching as many of us had hoped , h.r. 1817 takes several critical steps in improving our nation 's security and preparedness . 
it authorizes sufficient funding to hire an additional 2 , 000 border patrol agents , which will help us meet the goal of 10 , 000 new agents over 5 years set forth in last year 's intelligence reform bill . 
the measure also streamlines the background check system for those working in sensitive positions , creates an assistant secretary for cybersecurity , and requires reform of the homeland security alert system so that more specific and targeted information can be provided to those who need it . 
finally , this bill will improve our intelligence and information capabilities by allowing new recruiting tools to attract the best-qualified analysts and mandating increased coordination in the dissemination of threat information to state , local , and private sector officials . 
but this bill could have gone further . 
while i understand the jurisdictional constraints facing the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) , i firmly believe that a dhs authorization bill should include critical components like port security , nuclear and chemical facility security , bioterrorism preparedness , communications interoperability , and rail and transit security . 
that is why i will be supporting a substitute amendment offered later today by the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. in closing , mr. speaker , let me again thank the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , ranking member , for their hard work on this legislation . 
it is not a perfect bill , but it is indeed an important and significant first step .
