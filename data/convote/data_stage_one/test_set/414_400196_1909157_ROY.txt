mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i will just close quickly in thanking the chairman , the ranking member , the staffs for the hard work that led to the underlying bill , but also to this particular amendment . 
this was done on a bipartisan basis . 
there was give and take . 
over on the senate side there is a companion that is somewhat similar that has , i believe , a 7-day timeline , and undoubtedly we will work together in conference to reconcile those two . 
but the good work done on a bipartisan basis in the house has led to what i believe is the right compromise , although i certainly will work with the other body . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
