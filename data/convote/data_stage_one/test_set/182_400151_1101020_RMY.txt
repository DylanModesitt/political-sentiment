mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from texas for yielding me this time . 
mr. speaker , one of the most important responsibilities of this congress is to defend and protect our nation from external and internal terrorist threats . 
some of the vital features of h.r. 1817 , the homeland security authorization act , include funding to train and prepare first responders , improvements in cyber security , improvements in container security and enhanced border security . 
the homeland security authorization act will authorize funding for 2 , 000 new border patrol agents and it requires the secretary of the department of homeland security to develop a plan to coordinate and address duplication problems between the customs and border protection agency and the immigration customs enforcement agency . 
most importantly , i am pleased the rule we passed last night allows the gentleman from georgia ( mr. norwood ) xz4002960 to have his amendment made in order . 
the norwood amendment , among other provisions , clarifies that state and local law enforcement agencies have the right and the authority to enforce our immigration laws . 
illegal immigration has become a threat to the security of many of our communities , even those not along our borders . 
the problem of illegal immigration has grown in part because local and state authorities have been uncertain of the jurisdiction regarding the apprehension , detention and deportation of illegal aliens . 
sheriffs departments throughout my congressional district have been burdened with unnecessary expenses in detaining and housing illegal alien criminals prior to ice involvement . 
the gentleman from georgia mr. speaker , immigration enforcement is critical for securing our nation from terrorists . 
a porous border that allows terrorists and the enemies of this nation to pass through undetected is unacceptable . 
mr. speaker , i encourage passage of this rule , passage of the norwood amendment , and passage of the underlying bill to strengthen our borders and protect our homeland from another attack .
