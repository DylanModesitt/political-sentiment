mr. chairman , i yield myself 2 minutes . 
mr. chairman , i offer this amendment with my colleague the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , a democrat . 
mr. chairman , this amendment simply states that the director of the fbi must personally approve any library or bookstore request for records by the fbi under section 215 of the patriot act . 
this amendment provides a higher standard for the use of section 215 by the fbi . 
at a minimum , what it will prevent i think is some kind of fishing expedition that might be undertaken by an overzealous agent or official at the bureau . 
having the director of the fbi sign off on the request , it also sends a signal to the library and bookstore owners that a request for information from the fbi is well thought out and comes from the highest level . 
this amendment compliments other amendments i have offered in the committee on the judiciary , two of which were accepted by the chairman and the committee . 
those were : with regard to section 215 , we clarified that if there is an inquiry , you not only as a respondent have access to an attorney to respond to the inquiry , but also to challenge it . 
the other had to do with another section in committee . 
we will stick with this one . 
with these two amendments on 215 combined , i think we have provided strong protections for the contested section of the patriot act . 
there has been a lot of attention , as has been noted here , across the country at this provision , which has been termed the library provision . 
it obviously has a lot more to do than with libraries . 
libraries are not even mentioned in it . 
but we see the need to make protections to be sure that no overzealous agent at the fbi or anybody goes and searches somebody 's library records or bookstore purchases . 
so that is what this amendment is prepared to do . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
