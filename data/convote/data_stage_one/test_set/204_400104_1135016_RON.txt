as the gentleman knows , this house passed the highway bill some weeks ago and the senate just finished the highway bill in their chamber . 
we will probably have to consider some type of short-term extension next week , hopefully an agreed-to extension bill . 
and if the senate requests a conference next week , i believe that the speaker will be prepared to appoint house conferees next week .
