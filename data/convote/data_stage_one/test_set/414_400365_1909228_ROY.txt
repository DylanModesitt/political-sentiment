mr. chairman , i support this amendment . 
i do not think that there should be a delayed notification warrant excuse for unduly delaying a trial , but we have heard an awful lot about delayed notification warrants here . 
let me again repeat the fact that delayed notification warrants were not created by the patriot act when it was passed 3 1/2 years ago . 
it was existing law for drug-trafficking and racketeering investigations , and the patriot act only expanded it to include terrorism investigations . 
mr. chairman , i would like to give members today a very vivid pictorial example on how these warrants work . 
using a delayed notification search warrant , the dea and other federal agents entered a home along the border between washington state and canada on july 2 , 2005 , because there was information that the first-ever tunnel under the border between canada and the united states has being used for drug trafficking . 
what did they find ? 
they found a very sophisticated tunnel , and took a picture of it . 
there were various camera devices and listening devices that the agents put into this tunnel , and they ended up finding that the tunnel had been used to transport 93 pounds of marijuana from canada into the united states . 
this is a picture of the u.s. entrance to the tunnel on our side of the border , very close to canada . 
it probably is best described as the u.s. exit . 
but on the canadian side of the border the entrance to the tunnel was in a building . 
so the contraband was stored in this building , was put into the tunnel , taken underneath the border and exited in the united states . 
now , the tunnel that i showed in the first picture was big enough to smuggle terrorists across the border , should it be used for that purpose . 
all this ended up being exposed as a result of a delayed notification warrant . 
the amendment is a good one ; so are delayed notification warrants .
