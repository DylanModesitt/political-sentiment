mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i rise again in support of this rule and in recognition of the importance of the underlying bill . 
this debate has clearly demonstrated exactly what is at stake . 
this house has an opportunity to ensure that law enforcement has the ordinary , but necessary , tools to fight terrorism . 
we can not , mr. speaker , and will not return to a situation that binds the hands of our intelligence and law enforcement communities . 
we can not and we will not allow an ever-adapting and determined enemy to gain the advantage because our law enforcement did not have the necessary tools . 
the usa patriot act and terrorism prevention reauthorization act will allow us to continue to make inroads into terrorist cells and operations . 
the goal has been and will continue to be to prevent another attack . 
in 2001 , the house joined together in a bipartisan way to pass the usa patriot act with 357 for , 66 against . 
this house must come together again to pass h.r. 3199 and continue to fight against those who would seek to destroy us . 
the legislative process for this bill has been both thorough and fair . 
republicans , democrats , department of justice , the aclu , and various other organizations have been able to speak freely and openly during the development of this bill . 
i believe , mr. speaker , the final product is solid and it will serve as an important framework to fight terrorism , protect civil liberties , and , ultimately , strengthen america . 
i want to encourage my colleagues to support both the rule and the underlying bill .
