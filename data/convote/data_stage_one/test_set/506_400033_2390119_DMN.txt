mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant support of this amendment . 
i have serious concerns about the changes to the current endangered species act being discussed today , both in the underlying bill and this amendment . 
i am especially frustrated that both bills repeal the critical habitat provisions of the esa , which are crucial to the recovery of species . 
i plan to vote against final passage of any legislation that repeals this important provision . 
but i will support the bipartisan substitute amendment by my colleagues mr. miller xz4002781 and mr. boehlert xz4000350 because it is an honest effort to present an alternative . 
it does not include the most egregious parts of h.r. 3824 which make a mockery of science and conservation .
