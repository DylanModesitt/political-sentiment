mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , throughout the history of this republic , the congress has proposed constitutional amendments and sent them to the states to overturn supreme court decisions that were particularly onerous . 
the one that comes to mind as coming to the top of the list was the dred scott decision . 
that was based on constitutional grounds , and congress proposed and the states ratified three amendments , the 13th , 14th and 15th amendment , to make sure that the mistake that was made by the dred scott decision would never be repeated again . 
there was a decision early in the country 's history under the constitution that related to the judicial power of the united states . 
the 11th amendment was proposed and ratified to correct that . 
and the supreme court also decided that levying income taxes violated the provision of the constitution on apportionment of taxes , and the 16th amendment was proposed and ratified to correct that problem . 
so when there is a court decision that has resulted in consequences that the congress and the states collectively deem are so bad that it requires an amendment to the constitution , this congress has not hesitated to propose an amendment to the constitution , and the states have ratified it . 
here we have had resolutions of all 50 state legislatures asking that we propose this amendment and send it to the states for ratification , and that is because the instances of flag desecration that have occurred have been deemed by them to be over the line and that the supreme court of the united states was wrong in its decision and it needs correction . 
i just go back to the quote that i made of the wisconsin supreme court when they effectively invalidated my state 's flag desecration amendment . 
it is up to the people through the constitutional amendment process to make the correction , and that is why we are here today . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from michigan ( mrs. miller ) xz4002761 .
