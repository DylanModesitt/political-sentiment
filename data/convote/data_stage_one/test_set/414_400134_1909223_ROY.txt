mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
let me just briefly thank the gentleman from massachusetts for working on this amendment . 
in the committee , with regard to other bills that we have considered , one having to do with providing a death penalty for terrorist criminals , this issue came up as well . 
`` domestic terrorism , '' is that too broad a term and how should it be applied ? 
if one causes injury to a federal building by mistake , are they then subject to these fines ? 
and nobody really believes that the death penalty would be imposed in that case ; however , the threat of something like that is out there , acts as a form of intimidation to people from engaging in lawful protest . 
so the overly broad definition does come up as a problem sometimes , and in this case it comes up as a problem when it has to do with seizure of assets . 
so i thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment forward . 
i am glad to join him and i am glad the chairman has articulated so well the need for this amendment .
