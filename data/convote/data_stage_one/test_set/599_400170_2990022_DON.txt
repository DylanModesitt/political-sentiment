mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i join the gentleman from oregon ( mr. defazio ) xz4001000 , my colleague , in asserting that we should stay here and complete the task that is before us . 
i say to my very good friend from florida that your and my chairman of the rules committee speaking about closed rules in another time made the following statement , that closed rules are anathema to democracy . 
when you argue that we are going to have time to do this , when we take the budget deficit matter up , what you are talking about is 1 hour on the rule , 1 hour on general debate , you say 2 hours , i will accept that , on general debate , 10 minutes in the motion to recommit , and that then is what 435 members and five delegates have that they can deal with in terms of time . 
the problems pointed out by my friend from oregon are significant , and the things that you have heard me say in the rules committee , the things that disturb me and distress me most are these things having to do with education . 
no one can tell me that they are not prepared to make the sacrifices for our children to have afterschool programs ; and yet , what we are going to find in that program are substantial cuts . 
there are no afterschool programs in the counties that i represent . 
in medicaid , it is no secret what is about to happen . 
when we cut medicaid , any way you cut it , you can slice it , dice it any way you want , states , get ready , because you are getting ready to have a significant problem with tax increases at that level . 
what part of national sacrifice do we not understand ? 
what part of closed rule that i heard so often in 1992 does the majority not understand that that does not give the members of this body the opportunity to come forward with amendments that might make sense with reference to fiscal responsibility here in the house of representatives ? 
those are some of the issues . 
mr. speaker , i have no additional speakers and i yield back the balance of my time .
