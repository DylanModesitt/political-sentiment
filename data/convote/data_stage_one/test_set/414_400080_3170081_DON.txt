madam speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i thank leader pelosi for her very succinct and moving comments . 
at the close of this debate , i will offer a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions to recede to the senate bill in its entirety . 
not that the senate bill is perfect , but it does a far better job at protecting civil liberties than the conference report by requiring that the documents and things collected through section 215 have some connection to a suspected terrorist and providing meaningful judicial review of uses of that authority . 
what is wrong with that ? 
the conference report makes sensitive and personal records even easier to get by making every innocent connection with a suspected terrorist presumptively relevant to a terrorist investigation . 
now , the senate bill also lacks a number of controversial and wholly unrelated provisions tacked on to the end of this bill . 
it does not have a lot of christmas tree in it . 
some 143 of the 216 pages of this bill have absolutely nothing to do with the patriot act . 
the chairman repeatedly admonished committee democrats that we were not permitted to consider matters falling outside of the 16 expiring provisions of the patriot act , but on the floor and in conference , this bill became a christmas tree for random drug laws , presidential succession amendments and federal employee benefit changes . 
some have argued that we must pass this bill now because it is the end of the session and it is so urgent . 
the house republican leadership waited 3 months to appoint conferees . 
where was the urgency then ? 
the patriot act does not need to expire if this bill fails in the house or the senate , which it should . 
my bill , h.r. 4506 , extends the patriot act for 3 months so that conferees may go back and make a truly bipartisan and bicameral bill . 
sunsets were a small step in the right direction but do not address the underlying problems . 
they are not a solution for bad law . 
we should instead be fixing the problems of the patriot act . 
sunsets will be of no relief to those who will have their constitutional rights violated in the next 4 years and should prevent no one from voting against this bill and in favor of the motion . 
this measure before us , this conference report , is neither bipartisan nor bicameral . 
in fact , not a single democrat in the house or in the other body would sign it . 
no one on this side has signed the conference report . 
it is the conservative house bill with window dressing . 
we should not let in the government sneak-and-peek provision for at least 30 days . 
the senate bill and federal courts allow a 7-day delay unless good cause is shown . 
and listen to these non-patriot add-ons ; it is a virtual christmas tree : it alters the presidential line of succession , criminalizes peaceful protest behavior , changes employment qualifications and benefits for federal employees and expands the death penalty for non-terror related offenses . 
the senate sticks to the real issues , so join me in a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions to recede to the senate bill in its entirety . 
madam speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
