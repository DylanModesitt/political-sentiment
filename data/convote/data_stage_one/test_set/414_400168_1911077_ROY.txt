mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i just want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , who supports the amendment , and also the chairman of the committee on financial services , who certainly would have been concerned if the concern of the gentlewoman from california were a legitimate one regarding our language . 
it is very clear that there would have to be a series of transactions . 
that series of transactions would have to lead law enforcement to believe that there is a financing of terrorism .
