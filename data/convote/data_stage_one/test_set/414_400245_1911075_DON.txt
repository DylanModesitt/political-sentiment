mr. chairman , here is my question . 
section 208 of the social security act apparently states it is illegal to use a false social security number for activities to obtain employment . 
if i am a 14-year-old kid and i go out and make up a social security number so i can get a job and pretend i am 18 , and i get money for it , have i violated section 208 ? 
and if so , if i deal with a bank , is the bank falling afoul of this terrorism statute ?
