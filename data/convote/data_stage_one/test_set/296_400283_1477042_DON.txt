mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this resolution because i disagree with this attempt to muddle our first amendment rights . 
i understand and acknowledge the passion that my friends and colleagues demonstrate today . 
it is disturbing to see images of someone burning the flag of the united states , particularly when we reflect upon the countless men and women who have given up their lives defending this symbol of freedom . 
when i was first elected to the house , i cosponsored a flag burning amendment . 
i did so for many of the same reasons that proponents of the amendment have expressed today . 
and yet looking back , i realize i was moved by my heart than by my head . 
history reminds us that the strength of america is derived from its basic ideals , one of the most important of which is tolerance for the full expression of ideas , even the acts that we consider obnoxious . 
as our founding fathers originally intended , the first amendment to the constitution has safeguarded the freedom of expression . 
tested through times of war and peace , americans have been able to write or publish almost anything without interference , to practice their religion freely and to protest against the government in almost every way imaginable . 
it is a sign of our strength that , unlike so many repressive nations on earth , ours is a country that not only accommodates a wide-ranging public debate , but encourages it . 
mr. speaker , a friend of mine and former senator of virginia , chuck robb , is a man who sacrificed greatly for his nation , in both the vietnam war and in his political career . 
exemplifying a `` profile in courage '' senator robb stood against public popularity when he voted against this amendment in order to defend the very freedoms that the american flag represents . 
in his moving senate floor statement , senator robb described how as a soldier he had been prepared to give up his life in the vietnam war in order to protect the very freedoms that this constitutional amendment would suppress . 
by showing the courage to vote against this amendment , he jeopardized his political career and subsequently lost his bid for me re-election . 
not having fought in a war , i should do no less than senator robb did in defense of die freedom he and so many of my peers were willing to defend with their lives . 
mr. speaker , this amendment should be defeated . 
in our hearts and our minds we know that flag burning is not a threat to our freedom , limiting the exercise of individual liberty is .
