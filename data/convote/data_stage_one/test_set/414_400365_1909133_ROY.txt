mr. chairman , i believe this amendment is a good one because it centralizes responsibility in the hands of the director of the fbi in signing off on 215 applications for bookstore and library records . 
but in the context of the overall debate , what i think is missing from this debate is not whether there is a potential for abuse by the justice department , but whether there is an actual record of abuse . 
and there has been no record of abuse by the justice department with bookstores and libraries . 
they have publicly responded repeatedly that they have not used the 215 order to look at the records of people checking out books or buying books at either bookstores or libraries . 
now , what this bill does is it makes an improvement to the law where there is a specific method of contesting a 215 order by the recipient . 
but to say that all of these records should be exempt from law enforcement scrutiny is to turn our bookstores and libraries into a sanctuary . 
we can not allow that to happen .
