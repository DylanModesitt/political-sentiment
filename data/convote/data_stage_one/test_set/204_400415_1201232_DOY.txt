mr. speaker , as a cosponsor of the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , i believe that stem cell research holds the promise of scientific breakthroughs that could improve the lives of millions of americans . 
this bi-partisan legislation would provide federal funding for a wider range of research while establishing ethical guidelines . 
the most compelling arguments for expanding federal funding for stem cell research can be heard in the heart wrenching stories of individuals suffering from debilitating diseases for which there are currently no cures or treatments . 
while it is too late for the countless americans who have passed away from terrible diseases , it is not too late for the millions of other americans hoping this house will support funding for this potentially life-saving resource . 
for these patients and their families stem cell research is the last hope for a cure . 
this bill provides that embryos that are otherwise likely to be discarded can be used to help develop treatments for debilitating diseases and life saving cures . 
we should allow federally supported research to proceed to find such treatments and cures .
