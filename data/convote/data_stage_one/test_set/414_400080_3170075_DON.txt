madam speaker , i yield myself 35 seconds . 
i want to give chairman sensenbrenner the benefit of the presumption of a doubt about this section 215 business . 
what happens in the report is it makes it easier to get library and other records under section 215 by creating a presumption that records of anyone to come into contact with a suspected terrorist even accidentally , innocently , is relevant to an investigation . 
madam speaker , what he has done is he has moved a part of section 215 to another part of the bill , and that is why it does not operate that way . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , a ranking subcommittee member of the judiciary committee .
