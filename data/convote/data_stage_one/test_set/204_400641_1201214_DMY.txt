mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 , to provide for human embryonic stem cell research . 
the measure is a crucial first step toward helping millions of people who suffer today from diseases that are currently without treatment . 
by broadening the federal government 's investment in this nascent technology , i am confident that we will be able to offer help to these men , women , and children that would be impossible by conventional means . 
the room for growth in embryonic stem cell research is exponential . 
according to the national institutes of health , this work may one day be used in gene therapy and to overcome immune rejection . 
heart disease , alzheimer 's , krabbe disease and stroke are just a few of the maladies that this research could help to treat and eventually cure . 
my region in western new york has a number of great research institutes that boast a rich history of tackling devastating health afflictions . 
for example , roswell park cancer institute ( rpci ) , located in buffalo , implemented the nation 's first chemotherapy program . 
rpci 's center for pharmacology and therapeutics is one of few in the nation capable of all phases of drug development , from the conceptual stage through manufacturing and testing . 
this year , rpci 's strong basic and clinical research programs attracted major research grants and contracts totaling more than $ 75 million . 
the institute has sponsored or collaborated on more than 350 clinical trials of promising new cancer treatments and its developing cancer genetics program will rival the world 's leading programs in that field . 
the institute has also made significant contributions to the landmark human genome project , and its new center for genetics and pharmacology will adjoin the university at buffalo 's center of excellence in bioinformatics and life sciences and the new 72 , 000 sq . 
ft , $ 24 million hauptman-woodward medical research institute building that opened less than two weeks ago . 
the three centers form a state-of-the-art life science cluster in downtown buffalo that will transform lives in my district and across the world through the cutting edge stem cell and genomic research . 
western new york has made a commitment to curing disease , caring for the sick and preventing the needless loss of life wherever possible . 
our innovative institutes , led by some of the best researchers in the world , can make an immeasurable difference in people 's lives . 
it would be unconscionable , now that we are so close to the ability to use stem cells to fight off the diseases and maladies that plague us , for us to turn our backs and withhold that care . 
mr. speaker , i urge the house to pass h.r. 810 . 
we have the tools to save lives ; it is now our duty to use them .
