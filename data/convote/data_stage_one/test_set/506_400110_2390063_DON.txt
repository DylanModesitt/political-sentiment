mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the substitute . 
it is bipartisan . 
it is supported by members of congress from every part of the country . 
it is not only a unique and valuable bipartisan piece of legislation , but it is one that will work . 
like the underlying bill , the substitute would repeal the current requirement that the secretary designate critical habitat for endangered fish , wildlife and plants , before formulating a plan for species recovery . 
in order , however , to maintain a strong esa , the substitute gives a strong definition of what is meant to jeopardize continued existence of the species . 
science is the core principle of esa and we direct the secretary to issue , and regularly revise , guidance on the acceptable scientific measures . 
the substitute also creates a science advisory board to peer-review controversial decisions and offer other assistance when necessary . 
the substitute is going to provide a helping hand to landowners ; dedicated funding for technical assistance to private property owners ; a conservation grants program for landowners who help conserve the species on or near their property ; assurances that private citizens can get timely answers from the fish and wildlife service ; and reporting requirements so that we know how many applications are really going unanswered , and most importantly , why . 
the substitute directs the federal government to work with the states on a far broader and more cooperative manner than either current law or the committee on resources bill . 
the substitute directs the secretary to first determine whether public lands are sufficient to protect and save the species ; if we could protect the species , and save the species in our public lands , in our national forests , our national blm lands , and in our parks and wildlife refuges , we should do so without placing the burden on private landowners . 
mr. chairman , this amendment represents a broad bipartisan and fiscally responsible effort to move this process forward in a manner that can not only get an overwhelming vote of support in the house , but which can move on to the president 's desk for signature in the same manner as the original act . 
i urge my colleagues to support the substitute , and i say that it will be not only a successful undertaking , but one which will be much more in the interests of the landowners and of the species that we are trying to protect and preserve .
