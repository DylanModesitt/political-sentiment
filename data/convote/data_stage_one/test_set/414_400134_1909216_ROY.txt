mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i just want to say in closing , this has been a collaborative process . 
i appreciate those who have worked with us , and again my appreciation goes to the chairman of the committee for having such a thorough process and allowing us to have amendments . 
as i mentioned , we had a markup that lasted over 12 hours . 
many of these amendments were discussed at length , as were other amendments . 
i appreciate that and urge support of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
