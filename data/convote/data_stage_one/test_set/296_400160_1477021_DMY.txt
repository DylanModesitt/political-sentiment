mr. speaker , i thank my colleague and classmate for yielding me this time . 
i rise in support and as a cosponsor of h. j. res. 10 , an amendment to the constitution authorizing the congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the united states flag . 
our flag represents our country as a symbol of our nation and our veterans bravery throughout history . 
our servicemen and women are courageously fighting the war on terrorism and putting their lives on the line every day to protect our nation and the freedoms that we enjoy . 
while i am a strong supporter of the first amendment rights to freedom of speech and expression , hallowed symbols like the flag deserve to be respected and protected . 
those who desecrate our flag undermine that powerful symbol that really unites millions of americans , both alive and those who have died trying to defend our nation . 
flag-burning shows an ultimate contempt , and i think that is really what it is for , to show contempt and disrespect for our men and women fighting overseas now . 
we have the right to protest and object to the policies of this administration or any other . 
the most effective protest is not to burn the flag , but political action . 
go vote and organize people who agree with you to change the policies . 
protest as much as we want to change those policies , but you can not burn the flag . 
that is just the bottom line . 
this amendment would restore historic protection for our national symbol , and that is why i am proud to support this amendment .
