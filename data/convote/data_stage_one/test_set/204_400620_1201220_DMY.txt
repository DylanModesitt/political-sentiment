mr. speaker , i rise today to express my support for the stem cell research enhancement act , h.r. 810 . 
i would like to thank representatives castle and degette for their leadership on this important issue . 
recent advancements in medical technology have created hope for the millions of people , and their families , who suffer from the effects of diseases like alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , and diabetes . 
stem cell research may hold the key to better treatment options , and even a cure , for diseases like these and others . 
many of us will have lasting images of president ronald reagan and christopher reeves as their frail bodies deteriorated over the years . 
and i will never forget my own father 's battle against alzheimer 's and how his slow deterioration and passing impacted our family . 
their personal health battles took on a new meaning as the public debate heated up over the merits and ethics of embryonic stem cell research . 
as we look towards the future of medical research , we must always proceed with strict ethical caution . 
i believe the castle/degette legislation meets this criteria by establishing strict requirements for which new embryonic stem cell lines would be eligible for federal funding . 
federal funding of embryonic stem cell research would mean that research could advance at a faster pace while providing stringent requirements and oversight of the research . 
national and international involvement is needed to ensure research institutions and companies do not intentionally or unintentionally overreach their bounds .
