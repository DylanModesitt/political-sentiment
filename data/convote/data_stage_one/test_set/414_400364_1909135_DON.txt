mr. chairman , there are a lot of problems with section 215 . 
this amendment does not take care of many of them ; but by requiring the fbi director to personally approve the warrant , that will significantly reduce the chance that there will be abuses . 
so far as the ability to contest these , it is very unlikely that someone receiving one of these warrants will go through the cost of actually contesting it for someone else 's rights . 
there are no attorneys ' fees allowed in these proceedings , and it is just more likely that they will just give up somebody 's information . 
this requirement will reduce the chances that there will be abuses ; and although it does not solve all the problems , it will reduce the abuses , and , therefore , i will be voting for it .
