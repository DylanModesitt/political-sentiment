mr. chairman , i rise to address the amendment offered by the gentlemen from north carolina that relates to the federal contraband cigarette trafficking act . 
there is evidence that profits from the illegal sales of tobacco products have been funneled to groups whose interests are inimical to the safety of our country and its people and the congress should do all we can to ensure that source of revenue is cut off . 
however , indian tribal governments that are legally involved in the retailing of tobacco products are clearly not the types of entities we are targeting with this provision . 
as initially drafted , the coble amendment would have had the unintended effect of targeting tribal governments who are legitimately involved in the retailing of tobacco products . 
with the great help of the gentlemen from oklahoma ( mr. cole ) i understand an amendment has been incorporated that will go a long way to protecting tribal governments and tribal sovereignty . 
i also understand , however , that we have not had much time to refine the entirety of the coble amendment and that further refinements need to be made . 
it is my understanding that the gentlemen from north carolina has agreed to take up these outstanding issues in conference .
