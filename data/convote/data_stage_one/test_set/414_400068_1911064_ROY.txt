mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased that the president of the united states on two occasions has stated that we need to give our law enforcement authorities all the tools necessary to fight terrorism , and he agreed that he strongly supported the signal of a death penalty to deter this criminal acts , these criminal acts that are imposed upon our society . 
when i decided to run for congress , it was in response to the 9/11 attack after serving for a long time on the judiciary . 
i am sponsoring this legislation today because in my experience the death penalty does deter crimes , and it is my hope and my prayer that this tool given to our prosecutors and given to our courts and to our engineers will enable us to better protect freedom and protect our citizens from this disaster that lurks in the shadows along with these terrorists that attack our nation . 
i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for allowing me to offer this amendment and for all the great work that he has done on this reenactment of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
