i thank my colleague from texas for yielding me time . 
mr. chairman , i would like to just point out that this is another one of the famous half-loaf amendments that we are being peppered with this afternoon . 
the amendment leaves `` interferes with an investigation '' open , but it does take away `` when it would delay a trial. '' we get half a loaf here again , so i can not oppose the amendment , because it did make some improvement . 
after all , what is progress , even if it may be slow ? 
but at the same time , this may be a nonterrorist provision within the patriot act , because we already have a provision for secret searches for terrorists . 
so letting this section expire altogether would not interfere with secret searches for terrorists at all . 
what we found out in our examination , the staff examination , is that 90 percent of the uses of the sneak-and-peak authority have been for nonterrorism cases . 
it seems to me that this amendment goes along in that same direction .
