mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying patriot act reauthorization . 
i would like to take a minute to highlight two aspects of this legislation that we probably will not hear a whole lot about today , but are very important to me . 
i am pleased that the conference report includes the amendment that i introduced and which passed the house 362-66 to increase penalties and update outdated laws to protect our rail and mass transportation systems . 
this provision , section 110 of the conference report , will ensure that those who conspire to commit attacks against our rail systems or fund such attacks can be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . 
while no penalties can deter some of these terrorists bent on causing death and destruction , these enhanced penalties on conspirators will hinder the efforts of terrorists to secure and finance their networks . 
the attacks on the rail systems in madrid and in the london underground have demonstrated the real threat that rail and mass transportation systems face . 
i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner and all the members who supported this important provision to add another layer of protection to america 's rail systems . 
also i want to commend the conferees for including anti-meth legislation in the conference report . 
methamphetamine is a large and growing problem in rural america . 
in west virginia , meth labs have been found in neighborhoods , endangering children and innocent members of the community . 
provisions of this bill enhance penalties for those who run meth labs in the presence of children . 
this bill also places restrictions on the sale of meth precursor chemicals that are similar to those that the west virginia legislature passed earlier this year and other legislatures throughout the country . 
provisions in this bill require that meth precursors be sold from behind the counter or from a locked cabinet and place better controls on mail order and internet sales . 
authorization in this legislation will ensure that the meth hot spots grant program will continue . 
this program has already provided assistance to local law enforcement in many districts , including the metro drug task force in my hometown of charleston , west virginia . 
continuing this grant program will enable congress to continue to help our communities fight the meth problem .
