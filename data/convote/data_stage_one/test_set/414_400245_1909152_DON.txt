mr. chairman , i support this amendment although it does not make some of the changes recommended by mr. scott xz4003641 in committee about ascertainment and minimization that we believe are important . 
it would allow for the requirement of oversight , which i think is important . 
the chairman has said many times that hearings have been held . 
they were , but they were basically held since april . 
we do have a tendency to postpone our work until it must be done . 
one of the things that i hope we will take a look at that has not been discussed is section 209 relative to obtaining electronic information with a subpoena . 
that is a routine matter that caused no concern because it stored electronic data and that is not new law . 
the reason why we need to look at it before 10 years from now is that as technology changes and all telephone communication becomes voice over internet protocol , theoretically every phone call would be subject to seizure by subpoena , which is not something i think any of us would agree we intend to do . 
that should be a wiretap standard and it may drift down to a subpoena standard . 
that is why we need oversight , not because there is a bad guy out there necessarily , but because the technology is going to change and change swiftly and potentially very much alter what we think we are doing here today .
