madam speaker , i rise in opposition to the conference report to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
unfortunately , this bill does not do enough to protect the civil liberties of innocent americans . 
clearly , preventing another terrorist attack should be our highest priority . 
however , it should not be done at the expense of the basic rights guaranteed by the constitution , and that is what i fear we are doing today . 
like the version of this legislation i voted against in july , this conference report would make permanent 14 of 16 provisions included in the original patriot act passed in 2001 . 
i continue to have serious concerns about how this administration and future administrations could apply the provisions included in this bill . 
i simply do not believe that this body should relinquish its oversight duties . 
many of these provisions should still have sunset clauses , and congress should not be abrogating its responsibilities to review how these laws are being implemented . 
by agreeing to this conference report today , the house will effectively give up its oversight over sneak-and-peek searches , secret search orders , and surveillance authority provided by this bill given how little oversight we have had on these issues . 
our constituents expect more from us . 
why are oversight and an independent review so opposed ? 
while i applaud the efforts of the conferees to reduce the extension of two key provisions relating to roving wiretaps , which allows taps on multiple phones and computers of a suspect , and business and library records from 10 years to 4 years , this legislation is woefully inadequate . 
my constituents are concerned that the government is watching them just because they are visiting their local library or bookstore . 
under the patriot act , these records could be obtained with insufficient oversight by the courts or any independent review . 
law enforcement should spend its time going after the terrorists , not using valuable resources reviewing the library records of innocent people . 
unless we have an independent review , i know that i will not be satisfied that our rights are being protected . 
to make matters even worse , there are entirely new provisions in the conference report to expand the secret service 's ability to restrict free speech by creating `` exclusion zones. '' these provisions were included in neither the house nor the senate version of this bill . 
i would think that this expansion of the secret service 's authority at the very least deserves serious consideration by this body , and should not be slipped in at the last minute without any hearings or markups . 
my constituents have legitimate concerns about the lack of independent , judicial oversight over the provisions included in the patriot act . 
we all want terrorists to be apprehended before they commit horrific acts of violence against innocent people . 
all we are asking is that we prevent unnecessary civil rights violations by ensuring that the administration is not abusing its powers . 
but this new provision is just the most glaring example of the lack of diligence that this congress appears to have on protecting our rights . 
i am incredibly disappointed that throughout the entire debate on this legislation , the leadership of this house has refused even to discuss the topic of civil liberties , the very issue that makes this legislation so divisive . 
when the house debated this bill in july , the rules committee denied a bipartisan effort to debate an amendment offered by representatives christopher shays , tom udall and myself that would have made the privacy and civil liberties board , created by the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , more robust . 
this board would have been in line with what the 9/11 commission envisioned when they issued their report . 
today , 3 days before the 1 year anniversary of the signing of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , the privacy and civil liberties board has yet to i urge my colleagues to vote against this conference report .
