mr. chairman , i yield myself 2 minutes . 
mr. chairman , as it has been indicated , this amendment involves a lot of new definitions . 
it would be helpful if we had considered this in committee where we could have gotten the definitions straight . 
this is a complex rewrite of two different sections , 18 u.s.c . 
1992 and 1993 , which involve wrecking trains and attacks on mass transportation systems . 
first , it involves mandatory minimums , and we know from our committee deliberations that the judicial conference writes us a letter every time we consider a new mandatory minimum to remind us that mandatory minimums violate common sense . 
if it is a commonsense sentence , it should be applied . 
if it is not a commonsense sentence , it has to be applied anyway . 
in addition to that , there are problems with the death penalties in the bill . 
it would allow death penalties for conspiracy . 
that offers up constitutional questions . 
it also would create new death penalties even in states that do not include a death penalty . 
mr. chairman , if we are going to deal with attacks on mass transit , it would be helpful if we would put the money into port security and rail security and bus security and fund those resources . 
that would go a long way in making us more secure . 
having four amendments like this when we have insufficient time to deliberate is not substantially as helpful as the money would have been in making us more secure . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
