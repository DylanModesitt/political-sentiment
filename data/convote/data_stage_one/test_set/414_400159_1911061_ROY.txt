i thank the gentleman for yielding time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the gentleman 's amendment . 
the gentleman from virginia just stated that this amendment is controversial . 
i am afraid i disagree . 
i do not believe it is controversial in the least , and i think we will see that when the votes are taken . 
mr. chairman , we must do everything we can to stop terrorists , and that starts with ensuring that all terrorist acts are punished swiftly and severely . 
this amendment sends a clear message that we take terrorism seriously , that we understand that terrorist acts are not just crimes . 
they are acts of war , war against our way of life . 
we must not waver in our message to those who wish to threaten the values we hold dear . 
if a terrorist strikes on our soil we owe it to the victims of an attack to punish those responsible with the heaviest possible penalty , the death penalty . 
to do less would be a disservice to those who have lost their lives and would send a signal of weakness to those who are willing to use any means necessary to seek our destruction . 
the gentleman from texas ( mr. carter ) xz4000680 described this amendment very well so i will not run through it in detail . 
but let me say that this amendment treats acts of terrorism just like treason or espionage because that is what these acts truly are , not only crimes against individuals but crimes against our nation . 
anyone who is thwarted in their attempt to carry out an attack should not be spared the heaviest penalty just because they were caught before they could carry out their heinous intentions . 
i was proud to work with the gentleman from texas ( mr. carter ) xz4000680 on this issue . 
i commend him for carrying this amendment forward . 
it is good work that the gentleman is doing . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment . 
it is very important that we send a strong signal to the world that we take these acts seriously , and serious acts deserve serious consequences .
