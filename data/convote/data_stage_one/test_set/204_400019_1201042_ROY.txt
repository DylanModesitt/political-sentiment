mr. speaker , a `` yes '' vote today is a vote for progress , for reason and for sound research . 
mr. speaker , it is conservative to conserve , and this bill utilizes stem cells that have already been discarded , discarded because in most cases those who undergo in-vitro fertilization have excess fertilized cells available . 
their only choice today has been for freezer storage , putting them up for adoption or discarding them , yes , into hospital medical waste . 
now we will add a fourth option , and that is to allow these embryos to be used for scientific research , to find cures for diseases that have afflicted americans , a large portion of americans , that threaten the lives of young people . 
this is not about life , this is about saving life , and it is important that the congress make this statement for a brighter future for many , many americans .
