mr. speaker , today the house can vote to give millions of americans suffering from diseases new hope . 
patients , doctors , and scientists are desperately awaiting the potential that stem cell research has for treating diseases like alzheimer 's , als , cancer , heart diseases , diabetes , spinal cord injuries , and so many others . 
my state of california is already on the way . 
californians overwhelmingly support this research and decided not to tie the hands of our scientists , not to block the promising new opportunities that stem cell research affords . 
now our congress has the opportunity to follow suit . 
this is the kind of research we wanted when we created the national institutes of health . 
federally funded research ensures that the public benefits and that the research is ethically conducted . 
i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 810 .
