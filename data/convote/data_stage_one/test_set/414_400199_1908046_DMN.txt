mr. speaker , i rise to join many of my colleagues in strongly opposing the restrictive rule set forth on h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005. '' as you know , in light of the world we live in now , this is a very important piece of legislation . 
having such a rule truly goes too far and limits the protections of the american people . 
there were many important and relevant amendments that were not ruled in order and i believe this could prove to be detrimental in the end . 
i must also express my dismay with the fact an amendment by my good friend , mr. conyers , was not ruled in order . 
this amendment , which centers on rail and port security , should have been allowed in . 
both rail and port security are areas we as a country need to focus more attention on particularly after what took place in london 2 weeks ago and apparently another incident has taken place this morning . 
let me take a moment to discuss an important amendment of mine that was not ruled in order . 
my amendment 141 , dealing with racial profiling , would have required the inspector general to appoint an official to produce a report to the house and senate judiciary committees showing a statistical breakdown of the race , nationality , or ethnic background of the subject of orders issued by the court under section 107 . 
every day , across the country , people of color are the victims of racial profiling and law enforcement brutality . 
skin color and national origin are seen by some law enforcement agents as a cause for suspicion and a reason to violate people 's rights . 
as a matter of policy and law , this body must use this very clear opportunity to set the record straight with respect to exercising good faith law enforcement practices . 
this amendment would have made that sentiment a reality . 
before closing , i am pleased to see that my `` safe haven '' amendment was ruled in order . 
this amendment seeks to allow the attachment of property and the enforcement of a judgment against a judgment debtor that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism under the `` forfeiture clause '' of 18 u.s.c . 
981 . 
the legislation , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
there are several examples of how the current administration has sought to bar victims from satisfying judgments obtained against the government of iran , for example . 
the administration barred the iran hostages that were held from 1979-1981 from satisfying their judgment against iran . 
in 2000 , the party filed a suit against iran under the terrorist state exception to the foreign sovereign immunity act . 
while a federal the text of the amendment previously referred to by ms. slaughter xz4003780 is as follows : at the end of the resolution add the following new sections : `` sec . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution the amendment specified in section 3 shall be in order as though printed after the amendment numbered 20 in the report of the committee on rules if offered by representative sanders of vermont or a designee . 
that amendment shall be debatable for 60 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent . 
`` sec . 
3. the amendment referred to in section 2 is as follows : at the end of section 8 add the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; ( e ) library and bookseller records. -- section 501 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 ( 50 u.s.c .
