mr. speaker , i yield myself the remaining time . 
mr. speaker , i will be asking members to oppose the previous question and , if it is defeated , i will amend the rules so that we can consider the amendment offered by the gentleman from georgia ( mr. barrow ) xz4006280 and the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 rejected by the committee on rules last night . 
mr. speaker , the barrow-markey amendment would direct the department of homeland security to promulgate regulations upgrading the security associated with transporting extremely hazardous materials such as chlorine , which is toxic by inhalation , and those materials that are flammable or explosive . 
mr. speaker , extremely hazardous materials are transported through virtually every community in the nation . 
several serious incidents have taken place that have clearly demonstrated the threat that exists whenever they are involved . 
i am disappointed that the republican leadership failed to include this important amendment , an issue that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later . 
but , unfortunately , under the rule , unless we defeat the previous question , we will not be able to . 
as always , i want to emphasize that a no vote on the previous question will not prevent us from considering the homeland security bill , but will allow members to vote on the barrow-markey amendment . 
however , a yes vote will prevent us from doing so . 
at this point , mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote , and request a no vote on the previous question .
