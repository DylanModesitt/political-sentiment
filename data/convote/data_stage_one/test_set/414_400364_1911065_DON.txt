mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
as the gentleman said , we had a little piece of a hearing , but it was not much ; and we did not have the opportunity to discuss this bill . 
it was not marked up in subcommittee or the committee . 
the committee elected not to make it part of the bill , and i would hope that we would make the same decision and defer this until it can be appropriately considered . 
i oppose the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
