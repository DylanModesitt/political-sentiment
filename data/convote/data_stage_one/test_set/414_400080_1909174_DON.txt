reclaiming my time , i am sorry i was not on the committee the day they had the hearing , but normally death penalty matters are not brought to the floor this way . 
normally i thought it was the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on criminal justice in the committee on the judiciary of the house that would be considering this matter .
