mr. speaker , i want to rise in support of the rule that will allow us to consider the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
mr. speaker , i think it is so appropriate , so very appropriate that this week , as millions of american taxpayers are finalizing their federal income tax filings that we are looking at what is one of the most egregious taxes and most unfair taxes to our small business community . 
i am one of those that fully believes that the death tax is the triple tax , because americans pay tax when they earn their income . 
then they turn around , they buy an asset , and they spend their money , and they are paying a tax on every bit of that . 
and then , when an american dies , they have to pay the tax again . 
this tax affects every american , especially our small business owners . 
i have found it very curious that some of my colleagues across the aisle continue to say it only affects the rich . 
well , in my district , do my colleagues know that it affects thousands of farmers , thousands of small business owners who are very upset about the death tax ? 
families everywhere would benefit from the repeal of this tax . 
when 70 percent of family businesses do not make it to the second generation , there is a problem ; and we know we can fix part of that problem , because it is the death tax . 
for too long the death tax has been a major factor in the failure of family businesses . 
the tax not only forces american families to hand over their hard work to the government ; family businesses spend millions of dollars every year trying to comply with these regulations . 
in addition , it discourages savings and investment , and it is costing our economy hundreds of thousands of new jobs . 
mr. speaker , 89 percent of americans want death taxes repealed . 
small business owners get it , seniors get it , the farmers in my district get it . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to join the leadership and to support this rule in favor of h.r. 8 .
