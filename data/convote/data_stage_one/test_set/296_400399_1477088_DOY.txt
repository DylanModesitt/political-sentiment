yes , mr. speaker . 
mr. speaker , the underlying bill is to prevent the desecration of the flag , the trampling of our flag , the misuse of our flag . 
the amendment that i have offered is to prevent the wholesale theft and desecration of the social security trust fund . 
in the past 4 years alone , this congress , of which i am a part , has taken $ 632 billion out of the social security trust fund that we promised the citizens we would set aside just for social security payments and used to run the country . 
the president has gone all around the country saying we have a crisis , that by 2017 we will be out of money .
