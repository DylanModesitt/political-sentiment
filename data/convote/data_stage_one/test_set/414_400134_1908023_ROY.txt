mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
mr. speaker , i just want to say that i am often critical of this process and have been known to be critical of the committee on rules on particular bills that have come through , but i have to say with this process and with the committee on which i sit , the committee on the judiciary , we have seen a very transparent , open process . 
we have had a series of 12 hearings over the past year , and we had a markup that went over 12 hours in which we considered more than 50 amendments , i believe , there . 
i was successful , with a few of my democrat colleagues , in attaching a few amendments at that time . 
i believe there are four that have my name on it that have been approved for today . 
a few of them have to do with section 215 . 
mr. speaker , i am not unsympathetic to the concerns that the gentleman from vermont ( mr. sanders ) xz4003570 has . 
i in fact voted for his amendment on the floor the other day with regard to 215 and library and bookstore searches and sales . 
i believe that we have addressed it sufficiently in this bill in the amendments that will be offered . 
we will offer an amendment later , myself and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , that will require the director of the fbi to actually sign off on any request for documents from a bookstore or library . 
that will help substantially . 
we also have another amendment to 215 we did in committee that clarifies it to make sure you can consult your lawyer , not just to respond to the order , but to challenge it as well . 
we have various other amendments that have been approved today , national security letters on the so-called delayed notification that have already been approved . 
i look forward to this process . 
i hope my colleagues will support this rule . 
i know it is a tough job the committee on rules has . 
i have worked , frankly , with a lot more democrats than i have with republicans on this issue over the past year . 
we formed the patriot act reform caucus , and a lot of us have worked very hard on these issues , and i am pleased to say that many of these amendments have been approved and will be offered today . 
mr. speaker , i would encourage my colleagues to support the rule .
