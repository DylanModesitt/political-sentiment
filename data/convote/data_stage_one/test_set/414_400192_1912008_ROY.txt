mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , very briefly , a mandatory minimum sentence covers two crimes . 
it covers dealing narcotics and facilitating and enabling terrorism . 
it seems to me a modest sentence of 20 years for those two heinous crimes . 
there is a definite link between the illicit narcotics trade and the financing of terrorism . 
we have taken a focused look at that link , and this is an attempt to disrupt it and destroy it . 
the gentleman from virginia uses the term `` common sense. '' i think it is the utmost of common sense for us to address the flourishing of illicit drug trade and its link with narcoterrorism , so i respectfully hope that the members will support this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
