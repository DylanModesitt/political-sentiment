in working with the minority leader 's office and your office , there have been requests to accommodate some members and start this debate early in the afternoon instead of early in the morning . 
i would , along with the unanimous-consent request , anticipate us working out an agreeable time , and i would expect after discussions already being held that we would anticipate the debate to start on that bill somewhere early in the afternoon and running for the length of time agreed to by both sides .
