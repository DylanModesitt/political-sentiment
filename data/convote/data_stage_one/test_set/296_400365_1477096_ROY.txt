mr. speaker , the points of order that the gentleman from wisconsin has been raising have been pursuant to house rules , and we should not be waiving the rules relative to the germaneness of motions to recommit . 
should the gentleman from mississippi offer more nongermane motions to recommit , then i think it is incumbent upon me , as the manager of the bill , to raise a point of order , should the rules of the house be violated by the motion to recommit , as they have been in the past .
