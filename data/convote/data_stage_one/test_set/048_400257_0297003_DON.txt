mr. chairman , i rise to join the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , in a colloquy on how certain provisions in this legislation might affect the governance of wia funding in new york state . 
this legislation provides governors the authority to take a portion of funds provided through the authorizing statutes of mandatory partner programs to cover the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers . 
i am concerned that this may create a constitutional conflict between the governor of new york and the board of regents . 
i offered an amendment to remedy this conflict in committee . 
the amendment i offered was language that is identical to language already included in s. 9 . 
i would ask the chairman if he would commit to working with me and my new york colleagues in conference to resolve this issue .
