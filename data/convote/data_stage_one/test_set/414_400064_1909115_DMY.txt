mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , congress undertook a review of bush administration proposals to strengthen our laws relating to counterterrorism . 
congress passed the patriot act in october 2001 -- which i supported -- recognizing that it needed to give law enforcement the proper tools to effectively combat new terrorist threats . 
the law took account of new changes in technology that are used by terrorists , such as cell phones , the internet , and encryption technologies . 
the original act gives federal officials greater authority to track , intercept , and share communications , both for law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering purposes . 
it vests the secretary of the treasury with regulatory powers to combat corruption of u.s. financial institutions for foreign money laundering purposes . 
it seeks to further close our borders to foreign terrorists and to detain and remove those within our borders . 
it creates new crimes , new penalties , and new procedural efficiencies for use against domestic and international terrorists . 
indeed , the patriot act gives federal prosecutors many of the same tools to use against terrorists that congress has already granted them to use against drug traffickers , for example . 
the original act also creates judicial safeguards for e-mail monitoring and grand jury disclosures ; recognizes innocent owner defenses to forfeiture ; and entrusts enhanced anti-money laundering powers to those regulatory authorities whose concerns include the well being of our financial institutions . 
congress did not grant all of the authority the president sought in the first patriot act , and sunsetted much of the act 's authority in 2005 . 
many of the wiretapping and foreign intelligence amendments sunset on december 31 , 2005 . 
the sunset provisions require congressional oversight because congress must take an affirmative action to keep these provisions in effect . 
i believe that congress should exercise greater oversight of the use of new authority under the patriot act , as i have some misgivings about the administration 's use of the new powers under the patriot act . 
over the past few years i have continued to insist on greater oversight by congress of the justice department as it executes its new powers . 
i am pleased that the committee includes sunsets for two provisions : access to business and other records , and roving wiretaps . 
i support additional sunsets for other provisions in this legislation such as the `` sneak and peek '' provision which allows delayed notification for search warrants -- and i am hopeful that the house will ultimately adopt the additional sunsets approved by the senate judiciary committee when this bill returns from conference committee . 
i am disappointed that the house leadership did not make in order amendments that would have : exempted library and bookstore records from foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) searches ; reformed the roving wiretap authority in fisa cases to contain the same privacy safeguards as roving wiretaps in criminal cases ; established the traditional fisa standards for search warrants ; required individual suspicion for records orders ; allowed citizens to challenge secrecy orders in records requests ; and extended the sunset clauses for numerous other provisions of the patriot act . 
i voted in favor of a number of bipartisan amendments to limit the justice department 's power and increase congressional and judicial oversight of the executive branch , including : requiring the fbi director to personally approve searches of library or bookstore records ; additional reporting to courts by law enforcement when they change surveillance locations under a `` roving wiretap '' ; allowing recipients of national security letters to consult with an attorney and challenge the letters in court ; and increasing reporting requirements and making it more difficult to obtain `` sneak and peak '' search warrants , which entail secret searches of homes and offices with delayed notice . 
we must not repeat the mistakes of the past , when the united states sacrificed the civil rights of particular individuals or groups in the name of security . 
whether in times of war or peace , finding the proper balance between government power and the rights of the american people is a delicate and extremely important process . 
it is a task that rightly calls into play the checks and balances that the founders created in our system of government . 
all three branches of government have their proper roles to play in making sure the line is drawn appropriately , as we upheld our oaths to support the constitution . 
i support h.r. 3199 but i hope as this legislation works its way through congress , we will include sunsets on the provisions we are reauthorizing , so that congress will continue to oversee the executive branch 's use of these new powers .
