mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i would remind the members of this body that this bill came to the floor waiving all points of order . 
the medicare prescription drug bill that is going to increase the national debt by $ 1.5 billion came to the floor waiving all points of order . 
we have acquired $ 2.1 billion worth of new debt in just the past 4 years , waiving all points of order . 
but if the gentleman is going to insist on not allowing a vote to protect the constitutional amendment to balance the budget , not allowing a vote to protect the social security trust fund , and not allowing a vote to protect the medicare trust fund , i see no further reason other than to point out that i really thought the republican majority meant it when they passed the contract with america , that they said they would balance the budget . 
i gave you an opportunity to do just that . 
i hope the speaker will give us an opportunity in the near future for you guys to live up to your promises .
