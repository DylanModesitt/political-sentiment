mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , the floor manager who is , i think , supporting the amendment , but he gives some very compelling arguments against the amendment . 
let me pick up from there . 
the major problem is that under this amendment the fbi can still compel personal records of anyone if they are relevant to an investigation , even if the person whose records they seek is not suspected of criminal or terrorist activities . 
is that correct ? 
may i ask the author of this bill whether or not that is true ? 
is it not true that the fbi can still compel personal records even if a person is not suspected of any criminal or terrorist activities ?
