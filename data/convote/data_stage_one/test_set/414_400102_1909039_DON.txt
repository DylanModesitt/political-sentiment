mr. chairman , i want to comment and express my appreciation for the remarks of the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) xz4002201 when he suggested that this has been a good process . 
we have significant disagreements , and they are healthy disagreements , i would add . 
but i think he made the point . 
there is no one , no democrat and no republican who wants to reconstruct that metaphorical wall that prevented the sharing of information . 
i do not know of anyone on either side . 
and that was the key and the linchpin , i would suggest , of the success of the patriot act . 
now , some have suggested that there has been no abuse discovered by the department of justice , and i will accept that premise . 
but i would also put forth that the reality of the sunsets were an encouragement on the part of the department of justice to ensure full compliance with the law as it was then written . 
if you will , one could argue that it served as a deterrence , that it encouraged good behavior ; and that is why some of us here on this side of the aisle are so passionate about the issue of sunsets . 
it is my understanding that this morning in the senate committee on the judiciary , there were a number of sunsets on various provisions that were approved , and they were full-year sunsets . 
i dare say , if various amendments relative to sunsets had been allowed and made in order , this debate could have been cut in half in terms of the time . 
i also want to speak to the issue of library records . 
my good friend and colleague on the committee , the gentleman from florida ( mr. feeney ) xz4001310 , talked about some using the library provision , if you will , as a red herring . 
well , the reality is that library records under section 215 can be gleaned under section 215 . 
yes , according to the attorney general , it has never been used , which just leads me to ask the question , well , why do we need it ? 
but , yes , it ought to be a concern . 
i would further suggest that in terms of if there is no concern about libraries , if it is a red herring , why does the first amendment that we will consider that was made in order have to do with the issue ?
