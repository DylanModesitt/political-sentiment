mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to conclude by thanking my colleague , the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 for his work on this issue . 
the fact that the library provision has not been used as of the last public disclosure does not affect the fact that many americans are concerned about their expectation of privacy when they go to the library , when they check out books on family matters , on health matters , on other matters . 
they do not want to fear that the government may be scrutinizing what they are reading . 
and because this has an impact on the behavior of americans , on the freedom to use libraries , it is an important issue , merely that fear . 
this amendment , i think , takes a small , but important , step to provide at least the confidence to the people of this country that no less than the director of the fbi himself or herself can authorize the use of this provision for library and bookseller records . 
i think it is an important step forward . 
i hope we make further progress . 
mr. chairman , i urge support for the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
