mr. chairman , i rise to oppose the substitute and to support the underlying bill . 
mr. chairman , it has been represented that this legislation is going to cost billions of dollars potentially , and for that reason we should reject it in the fiscal crisis in which we currently live . 
i just say to you that the cbo , which makes the estimates on everything we do around here , the official word for the congress to act , projects that the cost would be small over the 5 years . 
indeed , and i quote , `` would likely total less than $ 10 million. '' that was the cbo cost estimate to h.r. 3824 . 
fiscal conservatives like myself and grover norquist of americans for tax reform support this important legislation . 
nothing could be more conservative or more right than a vote for private property . 
so please vote `` no '' to miller-boehlert and `` yes '' to final passage . 
i might also note , as a representative of one of the districts that has vast amounts of property in the mountains and so forth , that a lot of small property owners , people who want to use their property , have that ability compromised by the cloud that is placed over their property once they get word of a threatened or endangered species . 
the bill of the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 makes it certain and provides a process for compensation . 
otherwise , a small property owner is faced with a big question mark , i call it a cloud . 
it is like a cloud on your title and it is not easily resolved . 
it can cost you many , many thousands of dollars and a great deal of worry . 
the pombo legislation eliminates this terrible burden we place on small property owners . 
please vote `` no '' on the miller-boehlert amendment and `` yes '' for final passage on the pombo legislation .
