mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to the job training improvement act , because it will reduce important job training programs such as the veterans employment programs , perkins vocational educational program and the vocational rehabilitation program . 
this measure consolidates the adult , dislocated worker and employment service programs and funding into a block grant , while also repealing the wagner peyser act and removing many of the federal performance and accountability measurements that make the workforce investment act such an important investment in our nation 's workforce . 
with the unemployment rate at 5.2 percent , it is reprehensible that this legislation will repeal a dedicated funding stream for one-stop centers where job seekers can learn about job opportunities , apply for aid and receive counseling . 
we all know what is going to happen if workforce investment act programs are block-granted . 
states are not going to spend that money where it is needed the most , which is to aid job seekers in this troubling economy . 
instead , these funds may be used to cover infrastructure and administrative costs . 
this will go against the true intent of the workforce investment act , which is to invest in our workforce . 
even more troubling is the fact that h.r. 27 reduces preventive in-school youth training programs which keep students from dropping out of school . 
president bush has pledged to expand the no child left behind law to high schools and require students to take annual tests in reading and mathematics through 11th grade . 
so the president wants to ensure that students and teachers are held accountable for learning standards , but he lacks support for programs that strive to keep kids in school ? 
as we all know , these workforce investment programs are already critically underfunded . 
they strive to meet the increasing demands placed upon them in an environment of increasingly inadequate resources . 
to be effective , these programs can not sustain these devastating cuts . 
finally , the workforce reinvestment and adult education act would eliminate the civil rights protections of americans , by exempting religious organizations from anti-discrimination requirements . 
the message that we are sending to the millions of americans who are unemployed , who are veterans and those who are in need of economic assistance is that we do not care about keeping them from falling further into an economic crisis . 
this bill fails as a reinvestment in our workforce and fails to aid the millions of jobless americans who need it the most . 
i urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the scott amendment which will protect current civil rights protections for employees and job applicants of faith-based organizations .
