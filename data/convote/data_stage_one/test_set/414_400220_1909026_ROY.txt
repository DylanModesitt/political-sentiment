mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
mr. chairman , i sit here and listen to this debate , and i have been through a number of the 12-or-so hearings that we have had in the committee on the judiciary on the patriot act ; and i want to compliment this congress , this bipartisan congress , that met almost with a sense of urgency and almost a sense of emergency to write this patriot act just 3-plus years ago . 
and throughout all of those hearings , we needed to put security in place , we needed to be able to access information . 
one of the standards was , why can we not access information in an international terrorist investigation as we can in a criminal investigation ? 
we set higher standards here in this congress rather than lower standards and , still , the debate comes back . 
but i am astonished and amazed and pleased and in admiration by the work done by this congress to put this language in this patriot act that has withstood all legitimate criticism . 
it has protected people 's rights . 
there is not a name of an individual who had their rights violated by the patriot act . 
we have had the hearings , and we have had serious deliberation . 
i hope we have a serious consideration of these amendments and final passage of a very good patriot act .
