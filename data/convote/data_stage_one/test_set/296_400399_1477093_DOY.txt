mr. speaker , to the gentleman from wisconsin , you have , using the power of the majority , blocked the vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the constitutional amendment to vote to protect the social security trust fund . 
now , i have additional motions at the desk . 
the next one would be a constitutional amendment to protect the medicare trust fund . 
would it be your intention to object to that as well and prevent a vote on this house floor ?
