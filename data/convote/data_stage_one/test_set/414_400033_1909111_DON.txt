mr. chairman , the patriot act was enacted in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , rushed through the house as a suspension bill the day after it was introduced . 
this process did n't permit the public , let alone congress , to fully understand it . 
the original bill was rewritten in the rules committee instead of the bipartisan bill that was unanimously passed out of the judiciary committee . 
luckily , there were a few sunset provisions that were intended to help keep people honest and evaluate the impacts on the public . 
we have now been fighting the war on terror longer than world war ii with no end in sight . 
the policy decisions we make affect the lives of everyday americans . 
it is important to keep these policies narrowly focused on items that are necessary for dealing with terrorism and today 's modern communication developments while not encroaching on american 's fundamental rights . 
this version is a missed opportunity to narrow the provisions and time limit their applications . 
the good news is the public is becoming more aware and involved . 
thirteen municipalities in oregon , including portland , have already passed resolutions expressing their opposition to the patriot act . 
it seems that the majority of congress has at least some reservations about this bill . 
there were more `` no '' votes than four years ago and a bipartisan effort to provide more checks and balances is growing . 
the senate version will be better , making it likely that the fiscal legislation will be an improvement over the existing law . 
i will continue working to give voice to the concerns and the experiences of oregonians , as together we fight against terrorism and protect the rights of each american .
