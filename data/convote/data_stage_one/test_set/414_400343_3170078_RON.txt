madam speaker , i rise in opposition to this conference report which would reauthorize the patriot act by making permanent the expansions of federal police powers that were temporarily put into the original bill and sunsetted in that bill . 
i am unmoved by the argument that we can have faith that , in the future , that there will be proper oversight because there has been proper oversight so far in determining whether or not the new police powers that were put in the original patriot act were abused . 
long after mr. sensenbrenner xz4003650 and myself and others are gone from here , these powers will remain , and congress may not have that proper oversight . 
let me note that the people in the pro-life movement should take note of what is happening here because the expanded police powers of the federal government will be used against them . 
our second amendment friends already understand that . 
proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration group in california , the fbi went after them in the last administration . 
when you expand the police powers of the federal government , no matter how much oversight we might have today and say that power is not being abused , we have opened the door to abuse . 
that is not what our founding fathers had in mind . 
our founding fathers said , only temporarily increase those powers in an emergency . 
otherwise , deny those powers to the federal government .
