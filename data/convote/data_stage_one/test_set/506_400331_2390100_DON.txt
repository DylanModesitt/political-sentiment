mr. chairman , i rise in support of the substitute amendment . 
it will significantly improve the species recovery which is an important part of our negotiating process that led us up to this bill on the floor today . 
it will assist landowners in their efforts to conserve species . 
the substitute will also include a statutory definition of jeopardy that will ensure that federal agency actions do not diminish recovery . 
that is a very important part of giving up the critical habitat designation , that we have an improved consultation process and an improved definition of what constitutes jeopardy . 
mr. chairman , i urge strong support of this bipartisan substitute and , again , opposition to the underlying bill .
