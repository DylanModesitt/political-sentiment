mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h. con . 
res. 95 and in support of both the substitute amendment offered by the gentleman from south carolina ( mr. spratt ) xz4003860 and the amendment of the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 . 
the gop budget resolution will put the department of veterans affairs programs at least $ 3.2 billion short to meet the current level of needs to our veterans . 
it is not just a matter that va will not be able to make critical program enhancements for servicemen and women returning from iraq and afghanistan . 
it is even short of meeting current services . 
the bush administration 's budget submission for 2006 requested less than half of a 1 percent increase for its health care services . 
the va has testified that it requires a 13 to 14 percent increase to sustain services annually . 
both the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 and the gentleman from south carolina 's ( mr. spratt ) xz4003860 amendments will support increased amounts funding for our veterans . 
if we thought it was ridiculous to grant tax cuts to millionaires while the deficit soars , how about cutting veterans ' programs in the middle of the war ? 
are we really going to promote a point of view that instead is deserving of our support by cutting benefits ? 
mr. chairman , i hope not . 
if we do , we should be ashamed .
