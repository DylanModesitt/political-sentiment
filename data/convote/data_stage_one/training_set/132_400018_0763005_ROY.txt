mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . 
the udall amendment would strike from the energy bill all funding for research and development into environmentally sensitive uranium mining and reclamation technologies . 
uranium mining is necessary for the production of enriched uranium that is necessary to create nuclear fuel used in nuclear power plants . 
the bill before us today paves the way for an expansion of the domestic nuclear industry , and we need to authorize funding to develop more environmentally sensitive uranium technologies to feed the growing demand for nuclear power . 
section 631 of the bill creates a uranium mining research and development program to improve uranium mining technologies . 
this important funding supports advanced uranium mining technologies that can allow mining operations to be conducted with greater environmental sensitivity . 
section 631 would also authorize funds for the development of new environmental cleanup technologies for the remediation of closed uranium mines . 
nuclear power is here to stay , and we need to support a strong domestic uranium industry . 
section 631 provides funding for environmentally sensible uranium mining to support a growing nuclear industry . 
with respect to the gentleman from new mexico 's ( mr. udall ) xz4004131 specific concerns for uranium mining issues in his home state , i would like to point out the provision specifically excludes new mexico from receiving any funding under this provision . 
so i am not sure exactly what his objection could be at this point , at least with respect to his home state . 
i would encourage my colleagues to vote against the udall amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
