mr. chairman , the mission is the veterans service organizations are a great voice for veterans here in washington . 
like the gentleman , they are constantly pounding their chest saying , i am calling for money , more opportunity for veterans . 
i insist that they help us go back to where the hospitals are and see that veterans are treated like real human beings in those hospitals . 
i can not get the vsos to do it . 
maybe i can get the gentleman to do it because the gentleman is obviously more concerned than the vsos are about those veterans benefits and the way they are being treated . 
mr. chairman , i ask , would the gentleman from california ( mr. filner ) xz4001330 join me in that effort , or does the gentleman believe the money is being spent very well at veterans hospitals ?
