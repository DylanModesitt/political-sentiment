mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
for some people , mr. chairman , we just can not get enough government . 
but we are drowning in a sea of red ink already . 
this is not a debate about how much we are going to spend on health care and education and housing . 
this is a debate about who is going to do the spending . 
we believe families should do the spending . 
we believe good things come from freedom , from opportunity , and freedom for families to choose the health care that is right for them , to choose the education opportunities for their children that are right for them , to find the best job in a competitive market economy . 
we can not have unlimited government and unlimited opportunity . 
the republican study committee believes in unlimited opportunity . 
mr. chairman , we urge the adoption of this amendment ; but should it fail , please , we ask the house to vote for the nussle budget .
