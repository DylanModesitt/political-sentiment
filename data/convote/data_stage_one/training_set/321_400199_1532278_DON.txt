mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding . 
i hope we can find an opportunity to find common agreement . 
let me just say that my colleagues need to understand that the administration believes in this structured agreement , a totalization agreement , because they understand that when americans are overseas working and getting benefits , that they would like those americans to ensure that their benefits go with them . 
that is the same relationship we should have with mexico , that when workers are here , their benefits gained here should follow them to mexico . 
i would oppose any language that would deny that right . 
i think the question of whether or not they are documented or undocumented , the administration needs to make that determination . 
i do not know if my colleagues are going to thwart the administration 's desire to find some common ground on immigration . 
if this language says that it is consistent with federal law , then i hope that this congress will work with the administration so that we will not be embarrassed internationally by denying nationals of another country their well-gained rights or benefits that they have gained working . 
we would not want that to happen to us . 
i will listen further to the debate . 
i raise a concern that they are denying those who are working their well-earned benefits . 
one thing we can stand for is you deserve your pension rights , you deserve your social security rights , you deserve your uninsurance rights , your health care rights , and it should not be taken away from you . 
nevertheless , i hope my friends on the other side do not do that . 
if the language does not do that , i would say to my colleagues that if this is a good resolution , we certainly will join in with it .
