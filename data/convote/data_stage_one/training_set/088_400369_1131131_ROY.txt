mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i stand in vigorous opposition to this amendment or any amendment similar to this . 
the point has been made that you can drill for gas safely . 
when you start drilling , you do not know what you are going to get . 
you do not know whether you are going to get gas or oil , and the environmental problems here are immense . 
thanks to the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 , we have had this moratorium in place since 1983 . 
we need to leave it in place . 
the environmental studies and testimony that would be required in order to negate any chance of pollution must be gone through before this house ever considers such a bill . 
so i would urge all the members to vote against lifting this moratorium . 
it is reckless . 
it is reckless to the environment of florida . 
it is a bad environmental vote , and i recommend its defeat .
