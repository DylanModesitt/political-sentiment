mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i appreciate the sentiments expressed by the gentleman from ohio , my good friend , and i understand that he is interested in the best interests of the people in this country , particularly the medicare and medicaid beneficiaries . 
but the fact of the matter is we have experience in this regard . 
we have the federal employees health benefits plan . 
none of the information about who they are , where they are located , what their telephone numbers may be , is distributed to anyone so that they may be contacted under the provisions of the federal employees health benefits plan . 
so why , under this new so-called medicare modernization act , are we communicating that kind of information indiscriminately to a whole host of companies that are now going to besiege senior citizens with phone calls that they are not going to welcome ? 
we have ways to communicate whatever information we want to to the people who may be the beneficiaries under this program , and they can do that through the existing medicare and medicaid programs very simply . 
there is no reason whatsoever to give this information out indiscriminately so that these people can be harassed . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
