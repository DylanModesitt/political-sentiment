mr. chairman , in a cautionary letter to the president last month , a group of defense experts including conservatives robert mcfarlane , frank gaffney , and boyden gray said the following : `` with only 2 percent of the world 's oil reserves but 25 percent of current world consumption , the united states can not eliminate its need for imports through increased domestic production alone. '' our dependence on foreign oil is putting our country in a perilous situation . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment because it will move us away from that perilous addiction to foreign oil and increase efficiency where we use the most oil , and that is the automobile industry .
