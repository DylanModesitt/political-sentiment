mr. chairman , if the gentleman would continue to yield , look , everybody wants efficiencies in this system ; but i will say , for a paralyzed veteran with a spinal cord injury , there is no better place than the va to get care . 
to keep that quality of care for those veterans requires investment in our system . 
we are all looking for efficiencies but i will tell you there is no independent person , including the va .
