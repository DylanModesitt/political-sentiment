mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
mr. chairman , the castle amendment is a sensible amendment to the base bill , and i thank the gentleman from delaware for offering it . 
people who present a false driver 's license to the transportation security administration are turned over to the proper authorities , but for some reason that is beyond me we do not add these people to our flight watch list . 
it blows me away that we do not already utilize this commonsense practice . 
improving the information contained in passenger screening databases will enhance our ability to identify potential terrorists from gaining access to airlines . 
we have taken some important steps to improve our security at airports , but we need to do more . 
this amendment enhances our last line of defense by tracking potential high-risk passengers without interfering with the rights of everyday travelers . 
it just makes so much good sense , and i hope that we adopt it quickly .
