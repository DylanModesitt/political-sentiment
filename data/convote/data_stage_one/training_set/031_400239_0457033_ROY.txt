mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
having no additional speakers under general debate , i would just like to close by saying that the discussion we have had thus far on this very important measure has been very healthy . 
the fundamental thrust of this supplemental is to support the troops in iraq and in the middle east . 
we do have funds that involve the terrible tragedy , the tsunami . 
the discussion will lead to amendments that will round out this debate . 
i expect it will be a very efficient , hopefully very speedy , debate .
