madam chairman , my district , the 6th district of california , just north of the golden gate bridge is a `` donor '' district . 
we pay a lot more in taxes than we get back , in fact , the median home price is approaching $ 1 million . 
this is almost three times the national median home price , and my constituents want their taxes to work for them . 
they want middle-class families in their area to be able to secure a gse loan . 
they want teachers , firefighters , and policemen who serve and live in areas of the country where the housing market is soaring , to be eligible for an gse loan . 
madam chairman , we can do that . 
we must preserve the section of the underlying bill that allows for raising conforming loan limits in high cost areas . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose the garrett amendment and allow fair home mortgage lending .
