mr. chairman , i would just say , along with what the gentleman has stated for the record , there are over 140 million cars and 85 million trucks on our highways . 
and today 3 , 300 , 000 of those cars and trucks all already are on our highways running on 85 percent ethanol . 
if we but use our fleets in a wiser way and help transition to these new fuels , we can make a difference in the pockets of every single american and leave a better world to our children . 
today , there are 187 , 000 retail locations in our country from which we purchase our fuels , but only 400 stations across 38 states sell e-85 . 
i want to buy . 
i just said to the head of gm , who came here to washington this week , to the auto caucus event , i said , sir , i want to buy a gm malibu powered by ethanol . 
do you sell it ? 
and even if i bought it , could i go to toledo and buy the fuel ? 
he said , `` i do not think i have that yet. '' i said , `` can you go back to detroit and figure that one out for me ? 
`` i know that the jeep liberty that is rolling off the lines in toledo today has , for the first time in u.s. history , a 5 percent biodiesel blend as original equipment , called b-5 . 
someday we are going to get that up to b-20 , and the farms in ohio that surround the cities that some of us live in are going to provide that fuel . 
and that money is going to be going in their pockets . 
we are going to have a new fuel-based age in this nation . 
i get pretty excited about this , because i have seen the future and it is in ohio , and it is in iowa , and it is in nebraska .
