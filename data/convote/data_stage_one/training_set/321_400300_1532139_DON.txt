reclaiming my time , let me simply say , i would be willing to let this amendment go by and have it temporarily accepted by the house , provided that there is an understanding that the committee reserves the right to change its mind during the conference process if we learn that the public interest requires us to oppose it . 
i do not want acceptance to be interpreted as the committee 's willingness without examining this further to allow this to continue until the authorization bill is passed . 
that might be a good idea , but i think we ought to keep that as an open possibility rather than make it as a commitment .
