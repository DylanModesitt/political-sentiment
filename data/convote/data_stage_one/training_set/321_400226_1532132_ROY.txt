mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment which is offered by the entire arizona delegation . 
i will consume very little time on this because others have greater knowledge about it . 
this amendment will ensure that all certified charter schools will continue to be eligible to receive special education and low-income funding . 
this year , the department of education made a sudden determination that charter schools operated by for-profit organizations are not public schools and are , therefore , ineligible for federal special education funding under the individuals with disabilities education act and title i low-income students . 
charter schools across the u.s. are u.s. public schools . 
they operate with taxpayer dollars and abide by the same laws as traditional schools . 
federal laws let states decide the qualifications for public schools . 
the kolbe-flake-shadegg-hayworth amendment would set aside the education department 's determination and allow appropriated funds to continue to serve low-income students and special-needs students who are schooled at charter schools . 
this has special significance for arizona . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from arizona ( mr. hayworth ) xz4001730 , a cosponsor of this amendment .
