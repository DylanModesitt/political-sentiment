mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , contrary to what the distinguished minority leader said , i offered to file a supplemental committee report . 
however , in order to do so , i asked that the authors of the amendment admit that the amendment did not specifically exclude the sexual predators from the exemptions they proposed . 
that offer was refused by the minority side of the aisle . 
the committee report does accurately state that sexual predators are not carved out of the exemptions that were proposed . 
it is not a misrepresentation . 
it accurately shows that the authors of the amendment did not draft those amendments as narrowly as they should have . 
and when we vote on legislation , we vote on what is on the plain text of the piece of paper , not on what the author of an amendment intended to do . 
i do not like to see this resolution come before us , but what i will say is that we were accurate , and if you do not want this to happen again , draft your amendments properly . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
