mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . 
i would hope that the gentlewoman would withdraw this amendment . 
this is a very important amendment . 
i see what she is trying to do here . 
but the regular forces are just as short . 
as a matter of fact , this bill actually does not provide enough money for the regular forces . 
i understand the technicalities of it , that it should not be in a supplemental , it should be in a regular bill ; but to put all the o & amp ; m money in the national guard would do a disservice to the regular forces . 
i just visited three bases . 
all three bases were short in o & amp ; m money . 
they were short in almost every category . 
so i wish the gentlewoman would withdraw her amendment . 
we will take a look in the conference to see if the national guard needs more o & amp ; m money , and we will see what we can do .
