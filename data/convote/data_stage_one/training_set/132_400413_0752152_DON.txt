mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for his leadership on this issue . 
i see a far different place than the two gentlemen that have spoken before us from the opposition . 
when i went up to the arctic national wildlife refuge , i saw a tremendously diverse area in terms of wildlife . 
i saw musk oxen , grizzly bears , arctic char , and this marvelous caribou herd , which is the largest in north america , migrate to cross the area that we are talking about drilling in . 
so there is a far different area than is being described . 
one of the things that has not been mentioned here is , two native tribes depend on the migration of these caribou , and they have asked the congress and they have asked the state of alaska to stand up for them and to say , we do not want to have the destruction of this migration , because their livelihood depends on having caribou , and their entire existence rotates around that . 
so i would urge my colleagues to support the markey amendment and vote down this dangerous energy bill .
