madam chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . 
madam chairman , i rise in support of this amendment . 
unfortunately , plant diseases are continuously emerging ; and they can threaten not only our agriculture but our environment and our public health . 
i think that in connecticut , for instance , i will talk about sudden oak death , which has been identified recently . 
we are looking at potentially massive deforestation , and we are working hard at the new haven experiment station to cooperate on research on the plant disease before our forests of connecticut are heavily impacted . 
we all know the results of massive deforestation : bad for our land conservation , bad for our environment , and it contributes to the lowering of , the actual lowering of our air quality . 
mr. chairman , i urge a `` yes '' vote on this amendment .
