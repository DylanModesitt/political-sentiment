mr. chairman , reluctantly i make a point of order against the amendment because it is in violation of section 302 ( f ) of the congressional budget act of 1974 . 
the committee on appropriations filed a suballocation on budget totals for fiscal year 2005 on july 22 , 2004 . 
the amendment would provide new budget authority in excess of the committee allocations and is not permitted under section 302 ( f ) of the act . 
i ask for the ruling of the chair .
