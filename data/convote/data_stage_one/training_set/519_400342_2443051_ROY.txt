mr. speaker , i am a little surprised by the discourse from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , very 1960s rhetoric for a 2005 problem . 
you can not regulate and put hurdles and tell the oil industry that is really global these days that you can not build refining capacity in america . 
it is bad . 
most americans , when they saw the hurricane strike , realized that 30 percent of our refineries were at risk , 30 percent . 
they understood that you can not concentrate our refineries in one place and that you have to have more capacity . 
the reason it is expensive is because we import refined product . 
americans understand that . 
your rhetoric today , the old-fashioned ideas of regulate and hinder and put hurdles up , will not solve these problems . 
it took 20 years to get here because we would not allow them to build refineries across this country to meet public demand . 
i tell you , i have working families in my district that pull up to that pump and talk about mortgaging their house in order to get it completely full . 
this is a serious problem , and it needs serious solutions . 
this bill goes a long way . 
it says we are going to protect the environment , we are encouraging some conservation , and we are going to build capacity so that we do not have to have this foreign dependence on refined product . 
i thank the chairman for doing this . 
this is the responsible thing to do , moving this country forward , and putting us in a place where we are not foreign-dependent and we have the ability to lower the prices and give stable prices in the future in this great country .
