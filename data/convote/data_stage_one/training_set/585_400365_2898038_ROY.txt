mr. chairman , i am happy to support this amendment . 
i think it plugs a hole in the original bill , and we certainly want to do whatever we can to prevent people from going into gangs and from being threatened if they are witnesses and are sworn to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth in criminal trials involving gang members .
