mr. chairman , allow me to shock the members on the opposite side of the aisle and join with them in support of this amendment . 
mas vale tarde que nunca . 
it means , better late than never . 
and while my colleague here , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , is absolutely correct , we have put the cart before the horse , i suppose it is never too late to try and correct our errors . 
i do think that we should have been involved in studies a long time ago . 
we are basically forever speculating and coming up with anecdotes without a basis of facts for our decisions . 
so i am hopeful that we will get the support of our colleagues in this congress so that we can study . 
while this is limited to the link between illegal aliens and gang membership , we need more studies on gangs , period . 
we need to find out , number one , where the young people are coming from . 
what is it about gang membership that entices them to want to be a part of that gang ? 
what are their parents like ? 
are they the children of those who are already incarcerated ? 
if we had an opportunity to support them getting back into school , moving out of neighborhoods , et cetera , what would happen ? 
so , again , even though this is a little late in coming , i do support the amendment , and i ask for an aye vote .
