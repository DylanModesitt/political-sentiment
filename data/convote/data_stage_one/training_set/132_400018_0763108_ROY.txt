mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i want to read a quote and have the gentleman tell me whether he thinks he said this or not . 
i quote from the gentleman from california ( mr. waxman ) xz4004250 : `` this level of oxygenation , required in the clean air act amendments , is high enough to achieve most of the benefits of oxygenated fuels but low enough to allow several different oxygenates to compete for market share . 
the leading oxygenates are ethanol and ethers made of ethanol , etbe ; or methanol , mbte. '' that is attributed to the gentleman as a direct quote . 
is that correct ?
