mr. chairman , in closing let me just say that , as the gentleman from arkansas , who is a physician , indicated , weight gain can be caused by contamination or other problems , even if that contamination was unknowing . 
under this bill , the attorney general would not be able to get an injunction . 
we should trust our states attorneys general and consumer protection agencies to do the right thing and not prohibit them from protecting our citizens . 
mr. chairman , i would hope the amendment would be adopted . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
