mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , do i oppose it ? 
yes , i oppose it . 
under this procedure i will oppose it . 
i will not support the diminution , the continued reduction of democracy in the house . 
and i think , yes , there could be a lot of free speech , but not by shutting it down in the house . 
i will say again , nobody can give us a substantive justification of why this is being done this way . 
look , this involves the constitution . 
it involves the complex issues of campaign finance regulation . 
it involves how you take technology and how you adapt basic constitutional principles to it , and that is to be debated by 20 minutes on each side , and that is to be preformed with no amendments . 
mr. speaker , it is a joke . 
it is self-parody . 
let us all defend free speech by not having any . 
i hope that this is voted down and that we then can have an appropriate debate under the rules of the house with amendments and with full discussion .
