mr. speaker , it is amazing to me that the chairman of the committee continues to smear other members of the house on this floor . 
the bill says nothing about sexual predators . 
the words sexual predator or abusers do not appear in the bill , number 1. number 2 , by the chairman 's logic any bill on the floor of the house that gives veterans benefits or gives educational benefits , gives benefits to sexual predators as long as it does not specifically exclude them ; and any such bill could be fairly described as a bill to give benefits to sexual predators . 
number 3 , i did use that language that the chairman quoted about the fugitive slave act , but i was not comparing parents to slave owners . 
i was saying that the two bills were similar in that both would use , and that was in the quote , both would use the power of the federal government to export the laws of one state into another , and all of these things are opinions . 
opinions are fine in the views . 
they are not fine in the reports of the amendment . 
that is where the smear is .
