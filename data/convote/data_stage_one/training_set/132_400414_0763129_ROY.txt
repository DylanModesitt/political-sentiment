mr. chairman , let me say at the beginning , i am no fan of mtbe , and my state has banned it . 
but let me point out a couple of facts . 
in this bill , the lust fund , leaking underground storage tanks fund , has $ 2.1 billion to clean up these tanks . 
we have an additional $ 1 billion for oxygenate as well . 
and a precedent exists . 
the federal government mandated that we had to have oxygenate in this bill in the past and we have done that before , we have done that with flu vaccine , we have done that for biomaterials access insurance fund . 
the government mandated it . 
we have to protect people that carried through on those provisions . 
i accept the agreement that is going to be made between the gentleman from new hampshire ( mr. bass ) xz4000190 and the chairman to work this out . 
please vote `` no '' on the capps amendment .
