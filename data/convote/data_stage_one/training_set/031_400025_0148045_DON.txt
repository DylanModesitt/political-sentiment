mr. speaker , what i would have asked the gentleman from georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 , had he been willing to yield some time , was to show me where in the 9/11 report it makes any reference to making any of the changes in the asylum law that are being proposed by the majority here in this bill . 
there is no reference to that whatsoever , because the 9/11 commission knew that terrorists and threats to national security can not get asylum . 
instead , the majority , because it does not agree with the commission on religious freedom , because it does not accept fundamental traditions of people who have a well-founded fear of persecution based on their political attitudes or their ethnicity or their religion or their gender , they do not want to make sure they are able to get asylum , they dump a whole bunch of things that have nothing to do with terrorism in here , not recommended by the 9/11 commission report , and then try to claim we are simply fulfilling the 9/11 commission recommendations .
