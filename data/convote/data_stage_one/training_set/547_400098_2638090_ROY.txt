mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . 
briefly , i want to note that the existing committee print already gives the regulator power to force freddie mac and fannie mae to sell assets for any possible safety and soundness problems . 
i am not sure that adding an additional test , one that is ill-defined , will accomplish any additional good . 
and it could do some harm . 
here is why : under this amendment , a regulator could decide to force a healthy , over-capitalized freddie or fannie to sell assets at a time when the housing market could ill afford it . 
the ripple effects on local homeowners , communities , and economies could suffer , all in the name of this theoretical term of `` systemic risk. '' i should add this approach is not consistent with the banking world . 
this power to punish a healthy institution in advance of any real safety and soundness problem does not exist in the banking world . 
and many banks are now the same size as freddie and fannie . 
i urge members to support the well-balanced committee print language .
