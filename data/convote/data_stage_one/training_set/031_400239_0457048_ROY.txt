mr. chairman , i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill and , therefore , violates clause 2 of rule xxi . 
the rule states in pertinent part : an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law . 
the amendment gives affirmative direction in effect . 
i ask a ruling from the chair .
