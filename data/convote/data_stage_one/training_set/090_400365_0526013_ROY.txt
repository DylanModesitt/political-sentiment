mr. speaker , i yield myself 15 seconds . 
mr. speaker , in 1995 , my friend from massachusetts said , in a habeas corpus bill , `` i want judicial review in a reasonable way . 
i want people who may have had their rights interfered with to be able to sue in reasonable fora. '' that is what this bill does . 
he was right then . 
i think this bill is right now . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from arizona ( mr. franks ) xz4001410 , a member of the committee .
