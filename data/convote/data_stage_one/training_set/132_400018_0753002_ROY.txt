mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
it may seem odd that i would ask the house to rise to give the gentleman the right to offer an amendment that i am going to oppose , but i think it is worthy of debate . 
we had a debate in the committee on energy and commerce on this amendment , and i glanced at it , and it appears to be the identical amendment . 
is it the identical amendment from the committee on energy and commerce ?
