mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i am not clear that i am going to ask for a vote on this amendment . 
if we get an appropriate assurance that we will work in conference from the chairman , we may not have to do that . 
i will ask the chairman to express himself on that subject .
