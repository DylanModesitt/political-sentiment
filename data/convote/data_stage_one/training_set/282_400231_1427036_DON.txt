i thank the chairman for yielding to me . 
mr. chairman , this is yet another occasion that chairman hyde and i stand shoulder to shoulder on attempting to reform the united nations . 
i strongly concur with the chairman , this is overkill . 
it is over-overkill . 
using the gentleman 's logic , it is difficult to see why he is not proposing a 95 percent automatic dues cut-off . 
but maybe upon reflection he might propose that on a future occasion .
