mr. chairman , it would seem to me that the regular order of the house would be to allow legislation that in fact meets the definition or the goal of the mission that we have been entrusted with . 
i wish that the committee on rules would have made this amendment in order because it is so critical to public safety . 
i concur with my colleague when he says if it is not made in order , then we have to concede the point of order . 
but what we are conceding is the life and death of american people , and that is not the regular order .
