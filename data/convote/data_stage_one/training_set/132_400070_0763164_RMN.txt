mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i am very concerned about the process by which terminals for lng will be selected in this country . 
let me say , i support natural gas . 
i support the use of liquefied natural gas . 
i understand we need ports . 
i also understand the nearer they are to the pipeline the better off we are . 
but the bottom line is that the process that is in this legislation which supplants the existing process , in my judgment , tramples on the rights of the states and the individual communities , as they have indicated in their letters to us , to be able to influence these decisions that are made . 
if you read this carefully , you will see that h.r. 6 requires ferc to consult with the state , but it clearly removes the directive that ferc base its decision on community support or opposition , which it does now . 
states do a heck of a lot more than consult . 
at times they can object entirely . 
there may be problems . 
in the case of one being located in the delaware river , new jersey has some problems with it , in terms of boats being able to turn and environmental issues , whatever it may be . 
there are a lot of problems across the united states of america . 
my judgment is that we are taking absolutely the wrong step by this rather strong measure that turns over to this federal commission the right to make local decisions . 
that is something that none of us in the congress of the united states should endorse . 
so for that reason i hope the amendment reverting to where it was before would be accepted . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
