mr. speaker , as a member of the committee on government reform , i am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of h.r. 438 , legislation naming a postal facility in berkeley , california , after maudelle shirek . 
this measure was introduced by the gentlewoman from california ( ms. lee ) xz4002370 on february 1 , 2005 . 
maudelle shirek , the granddaughter of slaves , was born in jefferson , arkansas , before moving to the bay area over 60 years ago . 
she became an activist and a community leader . 
certainly emblematic of her community , ms. shirek has spent a lifetime fighting against injustice , poverty , and housing discrimination . 
she is now 94 years old . 
in the 1960s and 1970s , she was active in the anti-war movement . 
she founded two senior centers , was one of the first elected officials to address the aids epidemic , and helped organize the `` free mandela movement. '' a well-known and outspoken former member of the berkeley city council and former berkeley vice mayor , maudelle shirek was instrumental in encouraging former congressman ron v. dellums to enter politics and has served as a role model for many people in the community , especially the gentlewoman from california ( ms. lee ) xz4002370 . 
earlier this year the young adult project 2005 , black history month celebration honored maudelle shirek 's `` life , legacy and service. '' mr. speaker , i commend the gentlewoman from california ( ms. lee ) xz4002370 for seeking to honor her constituent in her community , a former member of the city council , in this manner and urge swift passage of this measure .
