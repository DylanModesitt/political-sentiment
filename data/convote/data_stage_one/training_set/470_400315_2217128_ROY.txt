mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support of both the pence amendment and the child safety act of 2005 . 
i want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his tireless advocacy of families and children . 
while this legislation today is very much about using the force of federal law to confront child predators , we know that the fuel that fires the wicked hearts of child predators is child pornography ; and my amendment , which is drawn from the child pornography prevention act of 2005 , is designed to give law enforcement the tools to stop child pornography at the source . 
it will fix a glaring loophole in the current law by requiring pornographers to keep records of the names and ages of their subject , proof of identification . 
this requirement , we believe , will deter the use of underage children in pornography . 
additionally , pornographers will be required to allow law enforcement to inspect their records . 
failure to do so will be a criminal offense . 
we also in this legislation extend federal jurisdiction to so-called `` home pornographers '' that use downloading on the internet and digital and polaroid photography to essentially create an at-home cottage industry for child pornography . 
it is time to protect our children . 
it is time to enact the pence amendment , the child pornography prevention act of 2005 and make it a part of this truly landmark legislation , the children 's safety act of 2005 .
