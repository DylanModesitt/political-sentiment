mr. chairman , i rise to oppose my friend 's amendment . 
i will tell you why personally . 
i spent a lot of time in saudi . 
they can either go the wrong way or the right way . 
we talk about not putting foreign troops in foreign countries . 
do they have problems ? 
yes . 
but when you talk about the government itself , i know from the intelligence community , i also know how they are helping us there ; but i have been into their banks where they have canadian and u.s. and british auditors to make sure there is no money laundering . 
the government itself , i have met with king aziz , i have met with the crown prince , i have met with almost every one of the shura council , which is their congress . 
the majority of saudis support the united states . 
so to say that their government is against us is wrong . 
are there people that preach wahabism ? 
yes . 
but they have changed their inside curriculum . 
they have arrested and jailed over 1 , 000 imams which preach intolerance . 
so i would oppose the gentleman 's amendment . 
i did not know when we were on the floor that we had an amendment when i went over there . 
it really hurts people when we do things , and i think that this could hurt our relationship instead of bettering it with saudi arabia . 
i oppose the gentleman 's amendment .
