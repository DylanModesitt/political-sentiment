mr. chairman , this amendment that i am offering contains two provisions . 
the first would amend title xviii to eliminate any statute of limitations on criminal prosecutions for kidnapping a child , committing a felony sex offense , or a human trafficking violation . 
eliminating these statutes for these crimes reflects the increased use of the success of dna in solving decade-old crimes . 
we have all heard about individuals who have been exonerated by dna evidence . 
however , there are even more reports of unsolved cases that have been solved and a perpetrator identified by dna evidence years after the crime was committed . 
this provision reflects this new reality and allows federal prosecutors to prosecute sex offenders and child abusers who have escaped apprehension because of the statute of limitations . 
i would note that this same provision was passed by the house in the 108th congress as a part of the child abduction prevention act by the overwhelming vote of 410 to 4. it was modified in conference with the senate as a part of the protect act . 
the second provision in this amendment raises the class on the existing misdemeanor for failure to report child abuse , thereby raising the maximum penalty for such an offense from 6 months ' imprisonment to a year imprisonment . 
i strongly urge support of the amendment .
