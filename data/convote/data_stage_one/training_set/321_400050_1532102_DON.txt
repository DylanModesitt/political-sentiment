mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i have , as he certainly knows , great respect for my colleague , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. regula ) xz4003340 , whose district and mine touch each other , are contiguous . 
and i just would reiterate though on this amendment that this is a medicaid commission that the white house is not even giving members of congress a vote on reforming the whole system . 
so they are going to come here with the commission recommendation from the white house to congress about cutting $ 10 billion , but are not even going to give any real congressional input because we will not even be able to vote on these recommendations . 
so in that vein , i ask members of this body to support the brown amendment on medicaid .
