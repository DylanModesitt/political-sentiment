mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i spent 8 years of my life as the michigan secretary of state . 
that was a job where i had a principal responsibility as the chief elections officer of that state . 
during that time , we made constant attempts to increase voter participation and voter turn-out , particularly among young people . 
and i believe this bill does that . 
mr. speaker , we must stand up for the right of freedom of speech and for the first amendment . 
i urge my colleagues to pass this bill .
