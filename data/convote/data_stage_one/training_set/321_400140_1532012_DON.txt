mr. chairman , if the gentleman would yield further , does that mean , and maybe we can discuss this again in the transportation hud bill , but that , since it is not a large sum of money , the president supports it , it has a lot of support here , that we can expect at some point in the process before we finish the appropriations , this program could be funded ?
