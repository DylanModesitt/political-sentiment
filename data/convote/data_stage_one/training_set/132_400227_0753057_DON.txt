mr. chairman , i enter my statement in the record in support of the solis amendment . 
mr. chairman , no one wants an oil refinery in their neighborhood . 
so in order to force one open , this bill encourages them to be established in neighborhoods with high unemployment or recent layoffs . 
the university of texas and the houston chronicle studied the air near refineries in the houston area . 
the paper wrote that they `` found the air ... .. 
so laden with toxic chemicals that it was dangerous to breathe. '' houston is not alone . 
multiple penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars for environmental violations have been handed to refineries so far this year . 
and we surely have not forgotten last month 's bp refinery explosion that killed 15 people . 
let 's employ the unemployed but not at the expense of their families ' health and well-being . 
that is kicking them when they 're down .
