mr. speaker , i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 , our democratic leader , who has been so supportive in our efforts to make sure that americans get a fair shake at the gas pump and when they heat their homes this winter and go to work each and every day . 
she has been there fighting for the american people .
