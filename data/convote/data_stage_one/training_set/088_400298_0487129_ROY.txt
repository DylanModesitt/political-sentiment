mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
as i said before , i rise with reluctant opposition . 
what the rsc has done is bold ; it is worth consideration . 
it will be part of the consideration as we go through the process , i am sure , throughout the rest of the year as well as we consider the budgets in years to come . 
but i would ask , as the author of the amendment just did , that while consideration be given that we adopt the underlying bill . 
and , therefore , i oppose the amendment , but with a great amount of respect and admiration for the work that has been done . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
