mr. chairman , i yield myself as much time as i may consume to just respond gently , firmly in some respects to some of the characterizations i disagree with of the budget that i am presenting and the republicans are presenting . 
i definitely respect the congressional black caucus in their effort to put together a budget . 
i admire anybody who tries to go through this process and comes out of the other end with an actual work product that they can come to the floor to defend . 
so , as a result of that , i am pleased to yield time so that they can present that budget . 
mr. chairman , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. butterfield ) xz4006160 so that we can continue this discussion .
