mr. chairman , i believe that this amendment actually saves american lives . 
mr. chairman , there is no better way to look at this issue than through the eyes of a young soldier stationed in the middle east . 
one of the reasons why we pay so much attention to the persian gulf is that the economy of the west is totally dependent on oil from this region . 
we must station forces there to make sure that nothing happens to our supply of energy . 
and nothing can change this situation right now . 
but this amendment can change this situation for the future . 
by adopting cafe standards , we will make the persian gulf much less important . 
we will reduce the need to ever deploy young americans into harm 's way . 
look into the eyes of a 10-year-old american and think of him or her , and vote for policies which will make it much less likely that any president would ever ask them to return to harm 's way in the persian gulf .
