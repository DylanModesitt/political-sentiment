mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i would like to associate myself with some of the remarks of my distinguished friend from maryland . 
he is right , bahrain is a flea on the elephant when it comes to the difference that it will make in economic impact to the united states . 
but if we really wanted to help in the middle east , maybe we would have sold parts for c-130s to iran and saved 100 people from dying because of our embargo on selling aircraft parts to a country that could not maintain safe aircraft because the united states refused to deal with them . 
maybe we ought to question whether this vote is really whether you trust the administration , an administration that many people think lied to us about getting us into war in iraq in the first place . 
many people think the administration is lying to us about torturing , and here we are talking about what is supposedly a democracy . 
is this any more of a democracy than saudi arabia ? 
it has a king . 
it votes , maybe . 
i think that the real issue is if we do not get it in writing , if we do not have enforceable rules , can we trust the administration or will the administration continue to sell out to the pharmaceutical industry , which will harm the people of bahrain , in repayment for campaign contributions ? 
these are the kinds of things that are at issue here . 
do you trust this administration ? 
do you trust them to help anybody but the very rich ? 
do you trust them to keep their word about what they are doing ? 
and if you do not , as many of us do not , you will voice that protest and vote against this bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
