mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the comments of the chairman and of the other members who have spoken . 
i understand that , again , our budget is a budget of priorities . 
the president had requested $ 500 million for the teacher incentive fund , and i believe that moving toward a budget that greater aligns our priorities in the area of education is important . 
$ 200 million would be left in americorps ; $ 200 million . 
that is not a paltry sum . 
in addition , the cbo has stated that this $ 70 million shift would in fact save $ 33 million . 
i do not know how they come up with those numbers , but that is how they score this . 
so we are spending $ 70 million and saving another $ 33 million . 
i believe moving toward the teacher incentive fund , which would , again , provide incentives for high quality teachers in our schools that would ultimately result in changing lives in a very positive way , is a positive amendment and a positive thing to do . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
