mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , before yielding to the gentleman from texas , i would simply like to say that i have here a copy of the cbo 's report on the budget , january 2005 , which shows that in the year 2000 we had revenues of $ 1 , 004 trillion under the individual income tax . 
last year , in the year 2004 , revenues were $ 809 billion . 
that is not an increase . 
that is a $ 200 billion decrease . 
one of the big differences between us and them is that we provide more for veterans health care and for veterans benefits . 
and now on that point , i recognize and yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas , mr. edwards .
