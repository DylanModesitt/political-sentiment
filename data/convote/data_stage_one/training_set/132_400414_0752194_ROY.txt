mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i have a trivia question for you . 
what automaker has the most vehicles that get a highway fuel economy of 30 miles per gallon or greater ? 
i will give you a hint . 
they make 19 of the vehicles , and that is more than any other automaker . 
do you know who it is ? 
general motors . 
what frustrates me about this debate is the misconception that cafe standards are some holy grail that foreign manufacturers can get to , but domestic ones can not . 
we do not need to micromanage our auto manufacturers . 
they are doing just fine . 
cafe standards are being met and they are being exceeded virtually every single day . 
but the more important work is finding real alternatives to gasoline-powered cars and developing them , for every dollar we force the auto companies to spend on the cafe standards is a dollar they will not spend on hybrids , hydrogen fuel cell and other alternative fuel cell vehicles . 
i am sick of hearing the same old debate . 
i want to get us to the point where we talk about which one of the new alternatives we are most excited about . 
i urge you to defeat this used amendment and vote for a new car . 
please defeat this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
