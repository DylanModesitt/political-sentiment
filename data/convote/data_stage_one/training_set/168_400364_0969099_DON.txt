mr. chairman , i rise to claim the time in opposition , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i would just say , this is interesting timing of the amendment , because we just passed the goodlatte amendment , and now we are going to study , i guess , whether or not we should have passed it because , as the gentleman from georgia has indicated , we do not know the link between illegal aliens and gang membership , and so we have to study it . 
we just passed an amendment to add 5 years mandatory minimum to sentences if a couple of them get into a fist fight . 
so i guess it is nice to know whether we should have passed it or not , but i just want to point out that it is an interesting place to consider this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
