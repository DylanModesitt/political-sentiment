mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , let me just close by raising these points . 
it looks like we are moving quite quickly . 
it is the question of having the answers . 
this has good intentions , but the answers of what dhs is doing , the training of tsa , what kind of standards are used in different airports . 
some tsa person might say it is a mistake , go back . 
others might make it in essence a federal crime and that person is prosecuted . 
so some you get in the database , others you do not . 
it is just a question of concern as to how this will work . 
again , it is a good idea . 
before i yield back my time , i would simply say that i would suggest that this amendment be addressed again in our hearings , to be able to detail out what would ultimately happen .
