madam chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
madam chairman , i rise to engage the chairman of the interior subcommittee in a colloquy dealing with some language in the committee report requiring the environmental protection agency to fund a national academy of sciences study concerning the hudson river . 
the language was added to the report unfortunately without the knowledge of those of us who represent the hudson river area in new york state . 
more than a decade has already been spent studying cleanup alternatives for the hudson river . 
therefore , the request for this new study raises concerns . 
those of us who live in the region would like clarification as to what the impact of this new study would be . 
from what i understand , the report language in no way is intended to delay , stop , or otherwise disrupt either phase i or phase ii of the pcb cleanup planned for the hudson river which is slated to begin in the summer of 2006 . 
is that the gentleman 's understanding as well ?
