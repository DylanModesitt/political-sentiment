mr. chairman , i urge strong support of the castle-markey amendment to h.r. 6 . 
this amendment would ensure that the states have a proper role in the siting of energy facilities . 
there is this photograph of a large tanker in boston harbor . 
i do not have the good fortune to represent a city like boston , but there are four , five or six communities in my congressional district , communities of 1 , 000 ; 5 , 000 ; or 10 , 000 people where a facility like this would change the basic characteristics of that community forever . 
some people are passionately for the lng facilities . 
other people are passionately against the lng facilities . 
i have told these folks they get the chance to decide and not a bureaucrat 3 , 000 miles away . 
vote for this amendment .
