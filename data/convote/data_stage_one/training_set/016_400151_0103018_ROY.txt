mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and today i rise in strong support of the solomon amendment and as a proud cosponsor of the resolution that is before us . 
for the last several years , a growing number of law schools have subjected military recruiters to various degrees of harassment designed to make military recruiting difficult and to frustrate their objectives . 
military recruiting on university campuses is one of the primary means by which the armed forces retains highly qualified new military personnel ; and it is an integral , effective , and necessary part of overall military recruiting . 
the constitution gives congress the power to attach reasonable stipulations to those who accept federal dollars . 
the solomon law simply ensures that the military has fair access to recruited institutions of higher learning that willingly accept this federal funding . 
mr. speaker , every year , without fail , the military comes under a great deal of criticism for hiring too many low-income , disadvantaged young adults . 
however , i find it remarkably ironic that these institutions are obstructing a more balanced recruiting effort that includes a patriotic commitment from all sectors of society . 
furthermore , the point has to be made that the soldiers , sailors , airmen , and marines that are being treated like second-class citizens at these universities are also the same brave men and women that are providing the freedom these schools enjoy . 
mr. speaker , efforts by these universities to restrict military recruiter access can only have the harmful effect of increasing federal spending to achieve mandated end-strength goals and ultimately compromising the readiness and performance of our military . 
in conclusion , mr. speaker , i strongly support this resolution . 
i sincerely hope there will be a strong bipartisan effort of support , and i commend my good friends from minnesota and alabama for their leadership on this issue .
