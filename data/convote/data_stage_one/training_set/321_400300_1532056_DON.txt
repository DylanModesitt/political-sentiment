mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i thank the gentleman for correcting me , i misheard . 
i happen to think that that is a tremendous program too . 
but the problem is all of these amendments , taken together , will limit the chairman 's ability to provide any flexibility at all in conference to fix these problems . 
so i urge the gentleman to think about it . 
he might be surprised at which programs are going to be bitten if the gentleman does not have the flexibility that he needs .
