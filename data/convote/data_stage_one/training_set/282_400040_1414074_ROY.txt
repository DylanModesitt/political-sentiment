mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i rise today to offer an amendment that would give the united nations greater flexibility in the peacekeeping operations that they are involved in by allowing voluntary military personnel to serve at the department of peacekeeping operations in new york . 
this was the norm until early 1999 . 
over time , 130 experienced officers had been loaned . 
they had expertise in mission planning , logistics , all of the things that are so important in these types of missions . 
there was a lull and because of the complaint of some of the other nations that 85 percent of this group came from developed countries , it was discontinued . 
as a member of the committee on international relations , i frequently hear of the problems that we have with peacekeeping , the atrocities in various parts of the world . 
again , i think that this is a situation that would greatly remedy that . 
rotating these professionals into the u.n . 
on a periodic basis provides a means for introducing new ideas , techniques , and experience without having to deal with terminating contracts or moving people and positions . 
it allows the system to deal with unexpected demands . 
the u.n. 's new operational responsibilities demand a more flexible approach . 
i think the other thing is that this would not cost anything . 
this would be a mechanism where , in fact , i think we could save a great deal of money by being much more efficient . 
we are asking the united nations to be more effective with their planning and their operations . 
the other thing that is important is that in no way does this require our department of defense to assign any u.s. military personnel . 
it only leaves the door open . 
i want to thank my chairman and thank the ranking member for their work on this and , again , our staffs . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
