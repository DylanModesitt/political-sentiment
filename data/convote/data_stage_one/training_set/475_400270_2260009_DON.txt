mr. speaker , let me just say this in order to clarify the whole issue on subpoenas . 
in section 5 it calls for joint operations , and it comes down to the majority party . 
the majority , basically , the bottom line , are the only people that can actually subpoena . 
so your statement was correct , the minority view on the committee or the democratic view on the committee , if we wanted a particular individual to be subpoenaed , could not be subpoenaed if we are not in the majority to be able to do so .
