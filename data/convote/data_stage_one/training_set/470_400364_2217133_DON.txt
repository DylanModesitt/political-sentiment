mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
mr. chairman , in the recent case of free speech coalition v. ashcroft , the supreme court indicated that if the material is not obscene it can not be prohibited unless real children are involved . 
this amendment prohibits simulated conduct , digital images that may have been produced without real children being involved . 
if real children are not involved , the material has to be technically obscene to be prohibited . 
the supreme court indicated in the decision that the fact that this material may whet someone 's appetite or the nature of the case caused problems for law enforcement , those could not be the grounds for violating the constitution in having material that is not obscene being prohibited . 
the case , whether you like it or not , and bringing it up as a floor amendment means we can not try to conform the language to the supreme court decision , so the only thing we can do is to vote against it if we believe in the constitution and if we read free speech coalition v. ashcroft .
