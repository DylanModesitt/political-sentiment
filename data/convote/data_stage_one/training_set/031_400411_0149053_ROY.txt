mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this most important issue affecting our country . 
i am a cosponsor of the real id act that calls for necessary reforms in our driver 's license processes to make it harder for terrorists to obtain driver 's license to use them for acts of violence in our country . 
driver 's licenses can be used by terrorists to enter buildings , obtain other forms of identification , and board flights . 
the loopholes that currently exist in issuing driver 's licenses have to be closed to stop those who would use driver 's licenses as a tool in committing terrorist acts on our own soil . 
in fact , as we have heard , we know that many of the hijackers who attacked our nation on september 11 possessed valid driver 's licenses and many other state-issued identity cards . 
the real id act would require applicants to prove that they are in this country legally . 
the debate here somewhat surprises me because i bet if you asked the american people if in order to get a driver 's license , if you have to prove that you are in this country legally , overwhelmingly i believe the people in this country would believe that not only is it the right thing to do but they would be surprised to find out that it is not already a requirement . 
the 9/11 commission stated that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of u.s. identification , and that for terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons . 
and their recommendation stated secure identification should begin in the united states . 
the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver 's licenses . 
last year as we heard the steady beat to implement the 9/11 commission recommendations , certainly , their recommendation that the federal government have standards for driver 's licenses is something that we ought to enact , and i support this bill .
