mr. speaker , in my 16 years in office , i have seldom seen such a blatant disregard for the truth . 
what occurred in this body last week during the consideration of the bill should be an embarrassment to every member of this congress . 
to purposely mischaracterize amendments offered during committee consideration of a bill is simply outrageous , and quite frankly , it sets a dangerous precedent . 
many of us have different views and even deep disagreements about the important issues we consider in this institution , but we should be using the power of debate to resolve those differences . 
instead , the majority is using parliamentary gimmicks and deliberate mischaracterizations to misrepresent the intentions of other members of this body . 
the official record exists to record the views and actions of the participants of the debate , not to editorialize and inflame the debate . 
to go so far as to change the descriptions of amendments , to use an official document to mislead the american people about alternatives suggested by the minority is a gross abuse of power by the majority , and it is just not honest . 
if we allowed this or similar action by either party to go unchecked , if we let this happen now , it will almost certainly happen again . 
the congress can do better . 
the american people certainly deserve better , and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important resolution .
