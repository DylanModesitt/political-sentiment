mr. chairman , i must rise in opposition to this amendment . 
knowing the economy of louisiana and particularly south louisiana , my district is very reliant on the oil and gas industry . 
the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. jindal ) xz4006340 gave some numbers that apply to what has happened with the leaseholds out on the outer continental shelf in recent times . 
just at port fourchon , which is the focal point for the gulf of mexico for oil drilling , deep and shallow water , we have increased the number of jobs there by thousands . 
we have 125 companies that have located at port fourchon , and there are 25 companies presently on the list waiting for locations to open up at the port . 
i am concerned , as most are , about the energy crisis in this country . 
i understand my colleagues ' concern about subsidies and big oil , as everyone describes it . 
at the same time , in order for us to reach some independence , we need to continue to encourage deep water , shallow water , oil , gas and every type of mining that will help us get out of this problem .
