in answer to the gentleman 's last question , if you look at page 4 , we have rulemaking in there , where the ftc shall promulgate the rules necessary and appropriate to enforce . 
under the rulemaking process , you , myself , just about all of us have an opportunity to put in our two cents ' worth on what we feel may be excessive , market manipulation , or price gouging . 
so , again , if you want to dwell on a word or two , i think all americans know when they are being excessively gouged at the pump .
