mr. chairman , this question of the well-being of our nation 's children is a result of the fact that children have increasingly become targets for identity theft . 
there have been sharp rises in incidents of fraud involving children 's social security numbers which have been documented . 
crimes using the stolen data are typically credit card frauds or the issuance of fraudulent driver 's licenses . 
however , it is not too farfetched to think that the misappropriations of the personally identifiable information of a person who has not attained the age of 18 could be used in a way that could bring about many of the offenses set forth in this act . 
so the objective of the amendment crafted by the gentlewoman from texas is to protect our children at all costs , and this amendment would do this by making it a crime to knowingly misappropriate the personal identification information of a minor in interstate or foreign commerce . 
the offense would be punishable by fines or imprisonment not to exceed 10 years . 
identity thieves often target children for these type of crimes because they are much less likely to notice that someone else is using their identity .
