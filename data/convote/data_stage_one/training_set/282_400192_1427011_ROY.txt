mr. chairman , if i may reclaim my time , i want to say to the gentleman from texas ( mr. gohmert ) xz4006510 , this is a marvelous amendment . 
the spirit in which it is offered is exemplary , and it is a very difficult thing to oppose it . 
but i see a problem with it that needs a little work . 
but i congratulate him and the spirit in which his good amendment was offered , but i hope it is not accepted in its present form . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time .
