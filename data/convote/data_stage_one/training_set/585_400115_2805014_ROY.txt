mr. speaker , i will say that this very important legislation , which i personally support , is at this moment being discussed by the leadership of the financial services committee . 
they are working with the department of the treasury and members in the leadership of the banking committee on the other side of the aisle , and we do hope very much that we will be able to put together a legislative package that can be considered before that very important december 31 date to which my friend referred .
