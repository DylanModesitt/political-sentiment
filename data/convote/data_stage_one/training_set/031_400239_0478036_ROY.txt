let me say that we made a major effort to see that veterans in our hospital did not have to walk around with folders under their arm . 
we insisted on computerization within that hospital . 
the gentleman could help me a lot helping the vsos to really work with veterans where they are being treated or not treated so well . 
mr. chairman , i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill which violates clause 2 rule xxi . 
the rule states that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law or imposes additional duties . 
i ask for the chair 's ruling .
