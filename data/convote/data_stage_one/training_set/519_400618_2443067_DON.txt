mr. speaker , since the 1973 energy crisis , we are no more energy independent now than we were then , and this legislation will do nothing to resolve this nation 's bankrupt energy policy . 
for those of you who support federalism , this measure goes in opposition to state rights ! 
our current energy policy is bankrupt . 
if this congress is to pass a real energy policy , here are some things what we must do : open up anwr ; invest the revenue into renewable energy resources ; and provide incentives to promote the ingenuity of americans to develop energy measures that are progressive and will rid us of energy dependence . 
the president has it right , we must conserve , but we must go further like improve cafe standards and provide incentives to build a high speed rail network . 
conservation is an american value , and it is lacking from this bill . 
this congress must craft a real energy policy that goes beyond the status quo . 
therefore , i urge that we vote down this measure , and support the democratic substitute .
