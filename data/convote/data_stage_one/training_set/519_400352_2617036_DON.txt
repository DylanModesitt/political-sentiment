mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , that is another example of the extreme republican majority in this house choosing their party over the country . 
they do not want to find out what the truth is , although that would be best for us to fix the problems that we had with katrina and then be able to respond to the next problem that we may have , whether it is a terrorism attack or another natural disaster . 
we would then educate ourselves . 
but to not give the democrats subpoena power to try to fix the problem because they hired all of their cronies in the top 8 or 10 positions in fema is , again , what is best for their party , not what necessarily is best for the country . 
and the democrats are providing , time and time again in committee , on the floor , with amendments , with ideas , whether it is lend the money , whether it is reduce the cost for prescription drugs , whether it is strip the billions of dollars in subsidies that went to the oil companies , the democrats have always provided an alternative , a change , to take the country in another direction . 
and that is what the democrats are for . 
let me real quickly give the e-mail address here : 30somethingdems @ mail.house.gov . 
i would like to thank our dual member from massachusetts and our member and a half from new jersey . 
with that , mr. speaker , i say this is not your father 's 30-something group .
