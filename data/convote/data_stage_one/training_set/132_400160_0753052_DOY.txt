mr. chairman , i reluctantly rise in opposition because the gentlewoman from california ( ms. solis ) xz4003840 is a good member of our committee , and we work on lots of issues together . 
i represent a blue collar district . 
we have probably more refineries in the district i represent now than anyone else in the country and those are our jobs , are our tax base and what economic development we have , and they are blue collar jobs . 
they are minority jobs in our district . 
i am concerned , though , about what is happening in our country . 
we continually transfer our blue collar industrial capacity overseas . 
my concern is we are seeing the same thing happen whether it be with refineries or petrochemical plants just like we have seen with our textiles . 
it would not be very difficult to move a chemical plant to where they are still flaring natural gas or to have a refinery ship us refined product . 
that is why i think the provision of the bill is really good , and i think the amendment does a disservice maybe to our whole country because we need to expand our refining capacity , again , reopening those , make them get the permits , but also make sure that we keep those jobs in our country instead of moving overseas .
