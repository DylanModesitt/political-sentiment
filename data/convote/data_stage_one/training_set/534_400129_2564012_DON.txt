mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to this bill . 
i would first like to say that i support the rights of gun owners and hunters , but this bill makes it clear this is not about the second amendment . 
this bill is about a direct assault on our civil justice system that endorses unscrupulous corporate behavior . 
once again , with this bill , democracy has been thwarted by bringing this bill to the floor . 
very reasonable amendments were offered , but the majority adopted a restrictive rule that prevented them from being heard on the floor today . 
one of those amendments would have expanded the ban on armor-piercing bullets also . 
for god 's sake , who in this country needs to own armor-piercing bullets ? 
we are not legislating via the intended democratic process . 
the people of this country want and deserve an open and participatory government , not law by fiat . 
i urge a strong `` no '' vote on this bill .
