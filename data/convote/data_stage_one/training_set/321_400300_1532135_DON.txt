mr. chairman , i rise to claim the time in opposition of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself 3 minutes . 
mr. chairman , i claim the time in opposition , not because i am necessarily opposed , but because i might be if i understood this correctly . 
this is not something that we have had a lot of notice to discuss , and i must confess considerable disquiet at the idea that we should overturn a report of the department of education inspector general with respect to the use of taxpayers ' money . 
as i understand it , the ig , and what i understand is on the basis of a 2-minute briefing , what i understand is that the inspector general ruled that a number of these schools were , in fact , private and not public and also questioned the way that at least two of the schools had spent taxpayers ' money . 
will the gentleman enlighten me with respect to the latter concern ?
