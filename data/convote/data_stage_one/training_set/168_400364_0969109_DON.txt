mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
having heard the distinguished views from my friend , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. waters ) xz4004220 and the gentleman from georgia ( mr. norwood ) xz4002960 , i am convinced that the amendment is well taken , however misplaced in time . 
we should have considered this before the gentleman from roanoke , virginia , but as my colleague has said , better late than never . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
