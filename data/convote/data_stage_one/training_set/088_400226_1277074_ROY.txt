mr. chairman , i rise today in suppor of mrs. delauro 's amendment to strike part of section 757 of title vii of the agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 . 
in 1966 , the arizona cotton growers association and the arizona cotton planting seed distributors deeded a piece of property located at 4135 east broadway road in phoenix to usda for $ 1.00 to help with the construction of the western cotton research center . 
with the construction of a new facility for the research center at the university of arizona'a maricopa agricultural center , the research and its staff will move within the next two years , leaving this property behind . 
i think it is appropriate that this property , which abuts the headquarters of the arizona cotton growers association , revert back to that group , since they deeded this property to usda originally for only $ 1.00 . 
i fully support removing the language allowing the secretary of agriculture to sell the wester cotton research center , phoenix , arizona and crediting the net proceeds of that sale as offsetting collections to the ars buildings and facilities account .
