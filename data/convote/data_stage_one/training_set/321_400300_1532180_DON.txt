mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
mr. chairman , i think the gentlewoman from connecticut has indicated correctly that there are a number of technical problems with this amendment ; yet i think i know that if there is a roll call , it will be passed overwhelmingly . 
so what i would suggest in the interest of time , unless we want to stay here until midnight , is to simply accept a number of these amendments which we know have significant technical flaws , but which can be corrected in conference . 
otherwise , we are going to have a lot of meaningless debates , and they will simply consume a lot of time , and we will wind up in the same place . 
so what i would simply urge is that the committee accept the amendment , recognizing that it needs to be fixed substantially in conference , and deal with some of the very practical problems just laid out by the gentlewoman .
