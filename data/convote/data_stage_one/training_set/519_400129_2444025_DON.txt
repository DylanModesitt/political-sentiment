mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of the stupak substitute and in strong opposition to the underlying bill . 
i would use this moment just to wake up the city councils and boards of supervisors and county folks around this country , particularly if you have had a closed military base . 
because this underlying bill just opens that up and says if the president of the united states decides we need oil refining capacities , they can puts it in your back yard . 
they waive all the requirements . 
they did make an amendment at midnight last night that is still vague , but says they have to following brac re-use law , but that does not affect federal lands that may be in the closed base . 
so essentially they could parachute an oil refinery in the middle of a closed military base , and it waives all of the requirements that are local , zoning and all of that . 
that just would not have any effect . 
i will tell you why this is crazy . 
because one of the bases that would probably qualify with a deep port and a lot of land is fort ord . 
fort ord , california , is surrounded by the national marine sanctuary and is one of the most beautiful areas in the whole united states . 
the last thing we should ever do is have an oil refinery there . 
this is a crazy bill , and i urge its defeat .
