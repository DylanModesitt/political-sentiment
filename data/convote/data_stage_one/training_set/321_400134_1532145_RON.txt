mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
this ruling did just come out , and in arizona we have i think the largest number of charter schools in the nation . 
most of them serve low-income , special-needs kids . 
in this case , that is who they are serving , and the ruling simply came out and said if they are structured as a for-profit ; they can not receive funds anymore . 
keep in mind , these are title i funds . 
these are special education funds . 
and for a school to be told , all right , you are not going to receive them anymore , these are disadvantaged kids in most respects that are going to be held at a loss . 
what we are saying is simply if the department of education needs clarification , we can do that with reauthorization , but do not in the middle of a process say to these schools , we are going to treat you differently just because of how you are structured ; although , we did not think it before , now we think it is different . 
so i think that the gentleman is wise to go ahead and accept the amendment , and as more information comes out , i am confident that everyone will feel comfortable with this decision .
