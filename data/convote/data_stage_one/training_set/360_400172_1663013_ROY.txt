mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of the resolution . 
this legislation is going to send a much needed strong signal to china . 
we do not support government-sponsored acquisitions of american corporations that clearly threaten our national security . 
i am extremely concerned at cnooc 's proposal to buy unocal , one of our nation 's leading independent natural gas and crude oil exploration companies . 
the chinese government owns over 70 percent of the china national offshore oil corporation . 
this is frightening . 
china is the second largest consumer of energy in the world behind the u.s. china 's only desire to purchase this energy company is to meet the demands of their ever-growing population and economy . 
we can not let this purchase move forward . 
what type of precedent would it set ? 
what would the chinese take next ? 
they have already taken the textile industry jobs , thousands of jobs from other business , whether it is currency manipulation , the intellectual property rights or even government subsidies . 
china does not play by the rules . 
why in the world would we expect them to do so now ? 
folks , this is a no-brainer . 
it is time for america to take a stand and say no . 
we have suffered too much . 
we can not allow the chinese to lock into one of our most precious resources and leave our nation vulnerable . 
support the resolution . 
i commend the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 . 
stop this move now .
