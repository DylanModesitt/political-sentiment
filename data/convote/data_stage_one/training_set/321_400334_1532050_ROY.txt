mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume just to close this out . 
mr. chairman , i think , again , these are both good programs . 
we had to make choices . 
in balancing the equities between the two , inasmuch as we put the $ 100 million in the innovative program and that is yet to be developed as to how it will be accomplished . 
but , we know with americorps that they work in the communities , do a lot of great work in getting people involved in mentoring and all kinds of other activities , and on balance i think we have to make a choice here . 
so , i would urge members to stay with the numbers that are in the bill , to stay with what we put in for americorps and not approve this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
