mr. chairman , i am honored to offer this amendment with the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 and the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 . 
i would only stress of all the learning disciplines , the arts tap and expand the human imagination the most , and in a world of exploding options for individuals and families , it is imperative when there is no experience to serve as a guide , that the imagination be stimulated and perspectives be applied and that values be brought to bear . 
it appears that the children of 20th century america lost something when they became captives to passive education offered by advances in media , particularly television . 
if we can learn from our mistakes , an emphasis on hands-on efforts , particularly in the creative arts , should become a focal point of 21st century education . 
for most americans , the arts are an optional endeavor . 
but for some , art is a principal means of self-expression and communication . 
for example , last month 17-year-old patrick henry hughes won the vsa arts 2005 soloist award for his piano and vocal abilities . 
in an interview , he said , `` i am blind and i ca n't walk , but i do n't let it stop me . 
i actually love the life i am living . 
if i have a sad moment , i go to the piano and get happy again. '' we must ensure that every young person with a disability has access to arts learning experiences . 
vsa arts , which are part of the arts in education programming eliminated in this bill , provides opportunities for children and adults with disabilities and stimulates millions of people , like patrick hughes , helping to transform their otherwise frustrating world into one that is more beautiful and purposeful . 
mr. chairman , the arts are not a luxury , they are the soul of society .
