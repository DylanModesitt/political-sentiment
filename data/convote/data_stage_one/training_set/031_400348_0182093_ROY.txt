mr. chairman , as chairman of the subcommittee on international terrorism and nonproliferation , i have to ask , who should be in charge of counterterrorism policy ? 
should it be the california coastal commission or should it be the department of homeland security ? 
that is the crux of this argument . 
now , environmental groups have successfully fought the completion of this fence over the years , claiming that it would have a serious impact on everything from the san diego fairy shrimp to the san diego button celery , all that in this 3.5 mile strip of desert along the border . 
does anyone think we can secure the border and save the button celery by putting up a fence to stop people from trampling on it ? 
yes , we can . 
can we protect ourselves from al qaeda operatives who have joined forces with alien smuggling rings like ms 13 in order to enter the united states through our porous southern border by stopping them from squishing the fairy shrimp as they slip through the gap in the fence ? 
yes , we can . 
it is a win-win . 
in the interest of national security , we need to defeat this amendment .
