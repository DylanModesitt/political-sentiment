madam chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
madam chairman , i commend the gentleman for acknowledging what i think we all should in the last amendment , that we are not giving funding , sufficient funding to this aphis account . 
now the gentleman 's amendment does not speak to plum pox because that would be legislating , so i would encourage the gentleman to support my amendment which we just voted on here because it would permit plum pox . 
that was one of the many pests on the list that would be increased in that case . 
but i commend the gentleman . 
he is exactly right . 
just like in the gentleman 's district , in the gentleman 's state , just like in new york , just like in louisiana with imported fire ants , just like in texas with the mexican fruit fly , just like in california with the mediterranean fruit fly , this is an underfunded area . 
we will never get it what they probably should ultimately get , but at least we should give them a little more , and i think the gentleman is exactly right . 
plum pox , asian long horn beetle , this is another reason why i hope all of my colleagues will support the amendment that we just voted down and will be having a recorded vote on later .
