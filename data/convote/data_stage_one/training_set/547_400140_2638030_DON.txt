mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
first , let me say that i am glad that the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. baker ) xz4000120 indicated the status of the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 , because i would not have wanted him to have been an unindicated co-contributor . 
i think that was very helpful . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. meeks ) xz4002710 , a very active member of the committee on financial services who is very aware of the need for housing .
