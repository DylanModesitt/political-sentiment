mr. chairman , i am mindful of the limitations that the appropriations committee is under when funding project requests for the army corps of engineers . 
i am also aware , however , that the committee works closely with the corps in this process , and that funding decisions are based largely on the priorities put forward by the corps . 
with this in mind , i am very disappointed that the energy and water appropriations bill that we approved today did not contain funding for the cleanup of a logjam on jacobs creek in my district in coffey county , kansas . 
i am disappointed because i have made it abundantly clear to the corps on numerous occasions that i hear more from constituents about this project than any other corps project in my district . 
further , i have asked the corps to make it one of their highest priorities when it comes to funds spent in my district . 
this logjam began in 1973 , but has only in recent years escalated to such a problematic level . 
currently , the logjam covers an expanse of more than two miles . 
along this stretch , boat docks are useless and garbage is trapped in the sediment . 
the clog poses not only a health and safety hazard to area residents , but it also threatens the economic viability of the region . 
if the corps had given this request the priority it deserved , it would have received funding . 
the absence of funding for this project in the bill leads me to conclude that the corps has once again looked the other way . 
i am disappointed that this crucial project has once again been ignored and i call on the corps to put their resources to work and remedy this situation . 
i fully intend to continue working to see that this project is funded in the final version of this bill .
