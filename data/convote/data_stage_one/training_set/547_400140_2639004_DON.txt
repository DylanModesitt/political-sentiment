madam chairman , i just wanted to add my voice . 
the ranking member of the subcommittee has spent a good deal of time focused on the corporate governance of these gses . 
he is one of the best students ever in the house . 
this is a very thoughtful and , i think , wholly constructive amendment . 
it does not detract from any of the purposes that we have . 
in fact , i think it would enhance them , and i hope the amendment is adopted .
