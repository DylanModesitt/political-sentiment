mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished gentleman from ohio ( mr. kildee ) xz4002160 a well-known champion for native american rights . 
we all have native americans in our states , and we have gaming . 
but , mr. chairman , sovereignty is not inconsistent with decency and humanity and human rights . 
sovereignty is not inconsistent with protecting underage workers and juveniles who are working . 
sovereignty is not inconsistent with making sure that workers have a quality of life . 
and sovereignty is not inconsistent with international treaties which ensure that that happens in nations around the world . 
this is a bad promise on a bad premise . 
and what we need to do is to work with the committees of jurisdiction and solve the problem , not eliminate the rights . 
i would hope that my colleague would join me on finding an amendment to stop the abuse of lobbyists who take money from native americans and indian tribes and reservations and not do a darn thing with it . 
i am offended by that . 
i will join the gentleman from arizona ( mr. hayworth ) xz4001730 anytime he wants to come to the floor to get rid of lobbyists who take money from unsuspecting native americans and their businesses . 
that should be a question of criminal violation , but this one is one that can be solved with good law and good negotiations . 
i ask my colleagues to vote `` no . ''
