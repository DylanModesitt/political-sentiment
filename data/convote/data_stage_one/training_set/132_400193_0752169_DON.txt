mr. chairman , i would , just in support of this amendment , report how successful our country has been previously with this experience . 
i want to point to a graph showing our fuel efficiency in 1975 , that when we were adopting fuel efficiency standards , rocketed up and almost doubled to 1985 , then stopped when we lost our commitment to fuel efficiency . 
and subsequently it has plateaued ; it has actually gone down . 
the average fuel efficiency today is less than it was in 1985 . 
i want to point this out , because it shows an american success story . 
we were successful in driving safe , efficient , fuel-efficient cars . 
and we got off the fuel-efficiency wagon . 
it is time to go back . 
we cut a deal with canada the other day . 
we can do it in america .
