mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york is really in many ways contrary to the reforms that are already enacted , led by the gentleman from delaware and the one that is now before us . 
the institution of two-thirds of the members was very important , and the reforms in the commemorative coin reform act , which was adopted almost 10 years ago , instituted a two-coin-per-year maximum . 
the reforms in that program have worked perfectly . 
congress has not passed more than two programs for issue in any year since the law passed in 1996 . 
one year , in 2003 , only one coin was issued . 
the reforms have restored the dignity of the commemorative coin program , which had spun out of control ; and similar reforms will do the same for a congressional gold medal . 
so it seems to me a natural progression in the reform process . 
and , indeed , mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
