mr. chairman , my amendment moves $ 3 million from the economic support fund , which has over $ 1 billion available , to the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund , which now has over $ 600 million available . 
it is not subject to a point of order and is both budget authority and outlay neutral . 
the reason for this amendment is very simple . 
it is to help pregnant women impacted by the tsunami . 
the intent of my amendment is to give $ 3 million to the u.n . 
population fund to assess tsunami victims in indonesia , sri lanka , and the maldives for very specific , pressing needs that i am very sure we can all agree are absolutely necessary at this time .
