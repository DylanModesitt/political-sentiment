i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
i want to commend my friend from texas for a very constructive amendment which the committee supports . 
this provision seeks to alleviate the plight of hundreds of thousands of burmese who have been forced to flee from their native villages by the repressive policies of the military dictatorship in rangoon , the same dictatorship that represses nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi . 
this amendment would facilitate the provision of much needed food , medical and other humanitarian relief , and i thank the gentleman for offering it on the floor today .
