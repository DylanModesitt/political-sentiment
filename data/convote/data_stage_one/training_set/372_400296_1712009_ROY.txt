mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute . 
i would just like to mention to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. woolsey ) xz4004360 that this bill is not about death . 
it is simply about making osha work , making the commission work . 
it is as simple as that . 
if you want to be against making osha actually work , and the review commission doing the job that the democratic congress wrote in the bill in 1970 , then vote `` no. '' mr. speaker i yield 3 minutes to my good friend , the gentleman from georgia ( mr. price ) xz4006261 .
