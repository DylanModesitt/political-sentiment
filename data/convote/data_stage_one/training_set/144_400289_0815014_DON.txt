mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for his answer . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 stated the point of this resolution pretty accurately and i think completely . 
i want to deal with some misstatements that have been made or have been reported to have been made in defense of this unconscionable , lying report of the committee . 
it was said on the floor of the house last week that the question is one of intent versus effect . 
my amendment was very simple . 
it said that grandparents and adult siblings of the person getting the abortion should not be subject to the provisions of the bill . 
it was reported as : `` mr. nadler xz4002890 offered an amendment to provide sexual predators an exemption from the provisions of the bill if they were adult siblings or grandparents. '' the fact is in the entire debate over that amendment , in fact , in the entire debate over all of the amendments , all of which were characterized as dealing with sexual predators , in the debate in the committee over those five amendments , no one , no one in the majority , no one in the minority mentioned the words `` sexual predators. '' no one in the committee debate said this amendment might protect sexual predators . 
it did not occur to anybody . 
so on that level the report is dishonest , and the chairman or whoever else had anything to do with it owes this body an apology .
