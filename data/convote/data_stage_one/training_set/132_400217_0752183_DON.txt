mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to this amendment . 
the national traffic safety administration is the body who sets those standards . 
there are standards . 
they scientifically set those standards . 
and sometimes they raise them . 
it is important that we keep that responsibility with ntsa who does a fine job with that , to set maximum feasible levels for the standards cars and trucks must use . 
i want to read from a good friend here who says , `` such a proposal would dramatically affect the functionality and performance of vans , pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles that consumers in america want. '' and that is by the united states chamber of commerce . 
one in 10 jobs are related to the auto industry . 
fuel economy standards are set scientifically , and this body should not get into that . 
we have standards . 
the american people choose the cars and trucks they want to drive . 
i believe that the standards are set fine . 
and as we go on , the millions of dollars that the industry has put into new development , new cars that are energy efficient we will see as time goes on . 
americans are working and we are winning . 
leave the standards to nhtsa .
