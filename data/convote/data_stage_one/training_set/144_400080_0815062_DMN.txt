mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , we have been called here today to raise a question of the privileges of the house . 
a very serious matter . 
a prerogative rarely used by the members of the house of representatives . 
but we have to deal with the mischaracterizations of the titles of the amendments , which is what this debate is about . 
it is incredible to me that the case of the other side is so weak that all they can do is continue to talk about the bill itself . 
we are not here to debate h.r. 748 , we are here to talk about the power and the abuses of the majority party that sets the agenda , that writes the reports , and that entitles the amendments submitted to the members of the committee on the judiciary . 
the amendment titles of three members were twisted and distorted and their meaning was rendered so that the entitlement of the amendment was not , indeed , accurate . 
i believe the majority has failed the congress but , more importantly , the american people . 
now , what we are doing here right now is hoping to raise this question of the privileges of the house regarding the blatant abuse of power ; republicans ' mischaracterizing the description of numerous democratic amendments , when some of the amendments had been considered in previous congresses . 
these are the same amendments that were properly entitled in other congresses . 
so it is with great reluctance that i come before you to ask that we make sure this never happens again ; that this deliberate mischaracterization of amendments be stopped here and now ; that it does not happen and that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary issue a supplemental report and apologize to the house of representatives . 
support the resolution .
