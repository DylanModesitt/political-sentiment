mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
in closing , i want to urge support for the amendment and also express to the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , for whom i have the highest regard , that i would like to work with him , along with the gentleman from virginia ( mr. tom davis ) , to find a middle ground and to resolve any concerns that he has . 
i was unaware of his concerns , but i certainly would want to take them into serious consideration . 
mr. chairman , i urge an `` aye '' vote for the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
