we do not have in the manager 's amendment the words `` unconscionably excessive. '' we do not have the words `` gross disparity. '' i am not disputing the intent . 
i understand that . 
i do question the advisability of putting that in statute when it is not defined . 
that is my question . 
can the gentleman answer questions about the strategic reserve ?
