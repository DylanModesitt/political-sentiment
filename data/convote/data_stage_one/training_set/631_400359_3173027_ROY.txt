mr. speaker , i would just like to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle that mr. gilchrest xz4001490 has spent a great deal of time in working with leadership on this issue , recognizing that there is a process problem here in that the oceans-21 bill that we all want to see passed is in the jurisdiction of quite some number of committees . 
for example , the agriculture committee has jurisdiction with regard to issues involving runoff . 
the armed services committee has obvious jurisdiction over issues involving the navy . 
the transportation committee is where the coast guard subcommittee is housed . 
the resources committee , obviously made up of interior members i might add , has great jurisdiction here , as does the financial services committee and the education committee . 
what mr. gilchrest xz4001490 is attempting to do here , and i support his effort very much , is to have a bipartisan commission made up that can work with leadership to work it through this morass , this maze of standing committees . 
if we do not do that , the sure bet is that this bill in this term is going nowhere .
