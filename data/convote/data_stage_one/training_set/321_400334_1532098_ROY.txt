mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , this amendment would prohibit funds in this bill from being used to operate the medicaid commission . 
i think we want to know what the facts are , because it is pretty much a consensus of opinion in this country that medicaid and medicare are going to be even greater costs than social security down the road . 
therefore , this commission is tasked with producing recommendations to have a $ 10 billion saving in medicaid . 
we all say we want to keep the federal budget under control . 
well , one of the things you do is get information , and that is what this commission is all about . 
i do not think we want to doom it to failure before it even begins its work . 
i would point out that our authorizing committees are struggling to develop reconciliation savings that include medicaid , and they need the input of the commission . 
what we need to do is to look at it and see where we can save money , and i think it would be a poor management decision to preclude their ability , the ability of health and human services and secretary leavitt , to address a very serious problem that affects all americans significantly . 
mr. chairman , i would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment if it comes to a vote . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
