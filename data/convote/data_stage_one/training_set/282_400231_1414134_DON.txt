mr. chairman , i thank my friend for yielding me this time . 
i want to commend him on this most important amendment . 
we can not permit countries such as iran to profit from their exploitation of the nuclear nonproliferation regime to acquire nuclear equipment and technology that they then use to develop nuclear weapons capabilities in violation of their solemn commitments under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . 
the markey amendment is a necessary step to establish a new global requirement that violators of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty must surrender all nuclear materials , equipment , and technology they acquired through the subterfuge of `` peaceful nuclear activities. '' this is a singularly significant amendment , and i urge my colleagues across the aisle to support the amendment .
