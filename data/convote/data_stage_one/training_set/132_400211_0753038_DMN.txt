mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
if the gentleman and my colleagues could read the amendment , it does not prescribe any format for the secretaries of energy or interior to use in creating this reserve . 
in fact , the reserve could actually be stored in the form of the raw material which is processed very easily and can be done immediately because the processing technology is on line . 
so it literally could be the type of commodity credit corporation booking that we use for other grains in our country and other material that we use in refining of alcohol-based fuels . 
so it does not say to the secretary that they have to buy it in this form or store it in a given form . 
they could actually store the grain and use the powers of the commodity credit corporation , for example , to broker those reserves . 
but nonetheless it would be available in the country . 
we are talking about a process that actually is simpler than refining petroleum and refining crude and one that is much less dirty . 
so if i could beg the gentleman as we move towards conference , perhaps , i would like to move forward with this amendment in some form to find a manner in which it can work and with which the gentleman is comfortable .
