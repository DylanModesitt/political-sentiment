mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i certainly sympathize with the gentlewoman and other members who have already spoken . 
i support pilt . 
in fact , we increased it some $ 30 million in our bill . 
and as we indicated with the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 a few minutes ago , we will certainly do more and we appreciate their bringing it to our attention . 
but the department of interior is responsible for one-fifth of the land in the united states and manages programs that affect over 4 million native americans . 
this amendment would eliminate 110 staff positions and drastically impact the management of numerous important programs , including the management of pilt , the very program that this amendment is intended to help . 
the pilt program is managed using staff from the department management account . 
the interior bill is a balanced bill . 
in developing this bill , the committee made a number of difficult choices . 
if we had additional resources , i believe pilt would be a deserving program and i certainly would try to increase it . 
but i urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent that further debate on this amendment , and any amendments thereto , be limited to 10 minutes , to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself , the opponent .
