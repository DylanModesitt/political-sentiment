mr. chairman , i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi . 
the rule states in pertinent part : `` an amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing law. '' the amendment imposes additional duties . 
i ask for a ruling from the chair .
