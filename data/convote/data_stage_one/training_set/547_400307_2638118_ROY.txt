madam chairman , i claim the time in opposition , although i am not opposed to the amendment . 
as a matter of fact , i am very much in favor of the amendment , and i congratulate the gentlewoman from california for her amendment . 
i know the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentleman from michigan ( mr. ehlers ) xz4001190 and others on our side of the aisle have been very interested in this entire issue . 
i think it is a worthy amendment , and we have no objection on this side .
