mr. chairman , i claim the time in opposition , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , it is with painful reluctance that i object to my dear friend 's dreams and his emanating bill . 
he is on the right track , god knows , but it is overkill . 
i think 50 percent bites just enough ; 75 percent might kill the patient . 
and so with reluctance and admiration , and a hope that he gets a good night 's sleep tonight , undisturbed by dreams , i must object to the amendment .
