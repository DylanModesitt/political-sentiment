mr. chairman , on behalf of the majority , we welcome and support the amendment by the gentleman from indiana ( mr. souder ) xz4003850 . 
the links between drugs and terrorism and the overall future of a democratic afghanistan are self-evident and important . 
it is critical that we take down and extradite to the united states those kingpins and warlords in the drug trade who are affecting our nation here at home and poisoning the new democracy in afghanistan and fueling terrorism at the same time . 
the souder amendment will let us know whether we are getting cooperation and support from the government of afghanistan on this critical part in the fight against illicit drugs : extraditions . 
according to dea , there are four pending u.s. requests for extradition from the government of afghanistan , including one major kingpin . 
we need to know if we are getting cooperation on these requests , and if not , why not . 
i support and strongly urge adoption of the souder amendment .
