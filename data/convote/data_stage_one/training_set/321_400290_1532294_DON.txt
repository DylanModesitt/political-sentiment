mr. chairman , i rise also in opposition to the paul amendment that is not cognizant of the fact that suicide is the third leading cause of death amongst youngsters . 
it would affect current funds used by states for mental health services and future planning to address this issue . 
it is a major medical concern , and this amendment does not provide for a solution . 
this amendment must not pass because it is harmful not only to our youth but to our families , to our nation , and would risk increasing the current statistics .
