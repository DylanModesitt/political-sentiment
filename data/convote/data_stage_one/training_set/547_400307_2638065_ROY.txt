mr. chairman , i would simply say in summary to ask the members to support the manager 's amendment . 
we need to support the folks down in the gulf region that were affected by the hurricane . 
the purpose of the manager 's amendment was twofold , to insure that money was available as quickly as possible to those victims who are 100 , 000 homeless , just in louisiana alone , to make certain that they can get access to that as quickly as possible ; secondly , to make certain that the groups that are building those homes are not political front groups for a right or left agenda , but ones who are sincerely interested in building with bricks and mortar to provide that opportunity to those folks . 
if you want to help those folks in the gulf region , and you want to make certain that money is used effectively and not in a political way , support the oxley manager 's amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
