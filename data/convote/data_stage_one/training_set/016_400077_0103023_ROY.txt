mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume ; and in closing , i would like to say i think we have had a good and substantive debate today , but let us be clear : the concurrent resolution is really about ensuring those who defend our freedom and liberty the ability to have the same access to colleges and universities that is available for everyone else . 
mr. speaker , often today others have placed this debate in the context of the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy . 
i suggest that those who would like to change that policy , that they look inward , at the political process itself . 
this was president clinton 's policy , and one enshrined in law that can only be changed by congress . 
if the other side of the aisle would like to make this change , they should propose it and debate it at this level . 
to put it in the context of the solomon amendment , i believe , is disingenuous and dangerous to our recruiting efforts . 
i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying concurrent resolution . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
the previous question was ordered . 
the resolution was agreed to . 
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .
