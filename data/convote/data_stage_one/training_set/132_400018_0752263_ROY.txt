mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i rise to qualify in opposition . 
and i say `` qualify '' because when i looked at the amendment several days ago , it appeared to me to be a reasonable amendment . 
since the gentlewoman was born in texas , it gave me another reason to say yes . 
and since she is a member of the committee on rules and every now and then i will need a vote from the minority on the committee on rules , there was another reason . 
so we had lots of reasons to say yes , and so we did say yes . 
then we found out that the gentleman from alaska ( mr. young ) xz4004401 , the chairman of committee on transportation and infrastructure , had some concerns about it , and the general services administration had some concerns about it . 
and the concern is that these intermittent escalators sometimes cause a safety problem because they start and stop too soon and they apparently break down more frequently than continuous-operation escalators . 
so here is my proposal to the gentlewoman : i am willing to accept it with the understanding that we are going to work with the general services administration and the gentleman from alaska ( chairman young ) to see if there is a meeting of the minds between now and conference . 
we will go into the base bill . 
it will be a house position when we go to conference . 
but if for some reason we can not satisfy these safety concerns , since i am probably going to be the chairman of the conference , i would reserve the right to drop it in conference after consultation with the gentlewoman if we can not work out some of these concerns . 
but for tonight we would take it . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
