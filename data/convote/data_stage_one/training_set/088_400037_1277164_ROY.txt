mr. chairman , i do rise in opposition to this amendment , and yield myself such time as i may consume . 
the gentleman from new york ( mr. sweeney ) xz4003930 , for whom i have a great deal of respect , has worked on this issue for some time . 
i know he also has a separate legislating bill that he is trying to move through the process , where this issue and this whole topic could be more appropriately addressed through the authorizing committee . 
this amendment will shut down an industry without having a hearing , or any due process . 
the amendment creates a crisis for animal health issues . 
it prohibits usda from inspecting horses that may have west nile virus , or vesicular stomatitis , both of which can affect other animals and humans if those horses are destined for slaughter . 
the estimated cost to feed and care for 50 , 000 horses is at least 60 to $ 100 million per year . 
who will pay , or will more horses go to the rendering plant instead ? 
what is the real effect of this measure ? 
there is no way of knowing , because it has not been vetted through the process . 
demand for the product will not change . 
almost all of the meat from the u.s. is exported , and those countries will simply find another source . 
i oppose this amendment very strongly . 
mr. chairman , i yield for as much time as he may consume to the chairman of the authorizing committee , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) xz4001540 .
