mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
let me just say to my friends and colleagues that this is a good amendment , and , on behalf of the majority , we would like to accept it . 
i would say very briefly that unless states which are in noncompliance with their nuclear nonproliferation treaty obligations , or which seek to withdraw from the treaty , are forced to give up their peaceful nuclear capabilities legally acquired under the treaty , they can use these to illegally develop nuclear weapons . 
as was pointed out by my colleague , such states as north korea and iran have already used their status as nuclear nonproliferation treaty parties to develop nuclear weapons , and this closes the loophole . 
it is a good amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield the remainder of the time to the gentleman from california ( mr. royce ) xz4003480 .
