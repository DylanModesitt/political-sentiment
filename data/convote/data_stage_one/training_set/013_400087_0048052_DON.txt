mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate my colleague on the other side . 
it is the pay grade issue i am concerned about , as the gentleman mentioned , as to who makes these decisions and as to why some individuals are successful in garnering a gold medal for an individual or group , and maybe another is not . 
there is some political judgment that is made as well , i believe . 
as the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 said , there is a process that will begin after this legislation is passed , nuances that members will work through . 
i would just offer , if this amendment were to pass , they would work through these nuances . 
as i mentioned before , if two gold medals were enacted into law by democrats and i had a third that i wanted to get passed , i would go to the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and say , mike , we do not have any more room on our side . 
here is an opportunity ; someone is deserving . 
would you consider sponsoring this and passing it ? 
i think , quite frankly , if there was a compelling argument , the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 would say , certainly , joe crowley . 
we will do it . 
that is a nuance to work through as well in terms of working in a bipartisan way . 
this simply ensures that both republicans and democrats are working in a bipartisan way , beyond the two-thirds vote ; that medals are not being used for political purposes , but are being given because the individuals deserve them . 
that is what we are trying to do with this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
