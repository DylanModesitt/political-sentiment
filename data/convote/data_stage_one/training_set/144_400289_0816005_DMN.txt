`` whereas the committee on the judiciary conducted a markup of the bill h.r. 748 , the `` child interstate abortion notification act , '' on wednesday , april 13 , 2005 , and ordered the bill reported on that same day ; whereas the committee on the judiciary subsequently reported h.r. 748 to the house on thursday , april 21 , 2005 , with an accompanying report designated house report 109-51 ; whereas , during the markup of h.r. 748 , representatives nadler , scott , and jackson-lee offered in good faith a total of five amendments to the bill , all of which failed on party-line votes ; whereas , because representatives nadler , scott , and jackson-lee called for recorded votes on their amendments , under section 3 ( b ) of rule xiii , the votes were published in house report 109-51 ; whereas , although it is the long and established practice in house reports to describe recorded votes with objective , nonargumentative captions , the committee on the judiciary majority departed from this practice in house report 109-51 by captioning these five amendments with inflammatory , inaccurate captions ; whereas , when representative sensenbrenner , the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , was asked about this language and given the opportunity to correct it , both in the committee rules and on the house floor , he instead explained that it was his purpose and intention to include these derogatory and inaccurate captions in house report 109-51 ; whereas , committee reports are official congressional documents to which american citizens will refer when seeking to interpret the bills they accompany ; whereas , although the committee markup and reporting process gives members ample opportunity to debate , characterize , and criticize each other 's views , committees have a ministerial , institutional responsibility to accurately report the proceedings of committee activities ; whereas , under the procedures of the committee on the judiciary , the minority must submit its dissenting views to the majority without having the opportunity to review the report ; whereas , the majority has the opportunity to review the minority 's dissent before filing its report ; whereas , earlier versions of h.r. 748 were reported by the committee on the judiciary on three separate occasions and in each case , these amendments , or similar amendments , were described in these earlier committee reports with objective , nonargumentative captions ; whereas , this unprecedented manipulation of a traditionally nonpartisan portion of a committee report constitutes an abuse of power by the majority of the committee on the judiciary ; whereas , a report of a committee offers the majority and minority the opportunity to provide their views and interpretations of the legislation , amendments , and issues ; whereas , the section of a committee report required by clause 3 ( b ) of rule xiii was purposely misused as an opportunity to comment on , or characterize , the amendments ; and whereas the vote captions published in house report 109-51 appear to be purposefully inaccurate and misleading , and reflect negatively on the integrity of the members offering the amendments , and therefore belittle the dignity of the house and undermine the integrity of the proceedings of the house : now , therefore , be it : resolved , that the house of representatives ( 1 ) finds that the committee on the judiciary purposefully and deliberately mischaracterized the above-mentioned votes in house report 109-51 ; and ( 2 ) directs the chairman of such committee to report to the house a supplement to house report 109-51 that corrects the record by describing the five amendments with nonargumentative , objective captions .
