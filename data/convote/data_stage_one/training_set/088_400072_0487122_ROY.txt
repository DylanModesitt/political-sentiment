mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding time and i thank the gentleman from texas for his leadership on this very important issue which i think is one of the most important issues that our nation faces in the long term . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the hensarling amendment . 
i do so because of a lot of reasons . 
i do so because the amendment in this budget is about simplification . 
it changes our budget functions from 19 that are really unrelated to the way we spend money around here to four simple budget functions , defense , homeland security , nondefense discretionary and mandatory spending , making the budget much simpler and easier to understand . 
it is about honesty . 
it creates a rainy day fund where we actually budget for emergencies . 
every single year we spend federal money on emergencies but we never budget for them . 
it seems to me if we know we are going to spend money , we ought to be honest and we ought to budget for it . 
it also is about accountability . 
it makes all of us more accountable because it has mechanisms on how we can enforce the budget which i think is the least we can do is pass a budget and stick by it and do what we say we are going to do to the american people . 
but most of all it is about fiscal responsibility . 
it starts the process of moving from the measurement of success on how much we spend to how well we spend . 
it does so in a way , as has been pointed out , it reduces nondefense discretionary spending by 2 percent , it reduces the size of growth in government in mandatory spending by just a little bit , and there will be those i think that government should be no exception because no family and no business is an exception to the challenges that we face . 
this budget gets us on the path of being able to meet those challenges in a very responsible way . 
i thank the gentleman for his leadership .
