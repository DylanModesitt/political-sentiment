mr. chairman , h.r. 3132 , the children 's safety act , is a good , commonsense bill . 
it seeks to protect our children from sex offenders and increase the tools for law enforcement and help defend the innocence of our children . 
my amendment would strengthen this bill by adding an additional tool for our state and local child protection services and by eliminating the loophole in our local laws which allow child adjudicated abusers to find sanctuary by merely crossing a state 's borders . 
this amendment is similar to legislation i have introduced in the house , h.r. 764 , which has strong bipartisan support . 
child abuse and neglect is an issue that crosses jurisdictions . 
it is , therefore , vital for federal and local officials to work together to ensure necessary laws and resources to fight child abusers are in place at every level of the government . 
mr. chairman , i yield to the gentleman from arizona ( mr. hayworth ) xz4001730 .
