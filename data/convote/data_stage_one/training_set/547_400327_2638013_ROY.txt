i thank you very much , mr. chairman . 
secondly , i would like to see clarification that the intention of the language in the manager 's amendment pertaining to `` overlapping board membership '' was not to disallow single individuals from serving on the board of two organizations . 
rather , the language was sought to disqualify affiliated organizations from participating in the fund where clear control of one organization is maintained by another which is participating in election activities .
