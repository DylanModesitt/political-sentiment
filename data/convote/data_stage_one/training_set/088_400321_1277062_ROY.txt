mr. chairman , i certainly appreciate the difficult fiscal times we are in . 
the gentleman and his staff have done a great job of trying to balance all the concerns , and certainly i appreciate the gentleman 's efforts and his staff 's efforts to address this specific concern . 
i look forward to working with the gentleman as we go to conference with the senate . 
in light of that effort , when we get to conference , i will be glad withdraw the amendment at the time and work with the gentleman and his staff in the months to come .
