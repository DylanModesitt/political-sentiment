mr. speaker , i would urge my colleague that just spoke that the many people that i know , and they are numerous in my state and elsewhere that were killed by guns and are advocates against guns , are not fanatics . 
they are people who are victims of murder . 
additionally , i thought i made it clear , i wish to make it clear again , that insofar as the second amendment is concerned , everyone that i know in this body is protective of a person 's right to own a gun . 
the fact of the matter is that manufacturers who act irresponsibly should be sued by persons if they so choose when that harm comes to them . 
mr. speaker , i yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. mccarthy ) xz4002570 .
