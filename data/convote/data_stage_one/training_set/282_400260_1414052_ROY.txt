mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , my amendment is relatively self-explanatory . 
it is an effort to add some commonsense reforms to the united nations in the area of employment , in the area of what their employees may or may not do with the entity 's monies while they are politicking in their own domestic elections and an attempt to make sure there is a record should they have outside unauthorized contact with individuals who are not members of government or the media . 
i would like to say that the rationale for bringing this forward is to provide a practical benefit to the reform effort at the united nations ; but i think it also is important that we recognize , as martin luther king , jr. , once said , `` there can be no great sorrow where there is no great love. '' we are engaged today to try to redeem the dream of franklin roosevelt that the united nations in the age of the nuclear bomb ; that in the age of a global war on terror , at some point we could have something at night to get us to sleep , and that is the belief that the united nations would be a force for good in the world ; that international disputes could be resolved there ; that the finest and most noble motives of humanity could find expression and implementation . 
mr. chairman , as the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 has said in a wonderfully elegant phrase , `` unfortunately the united nations at present is a derivative reality. '' so i am trying to inject some practicality into that derivative reality .
