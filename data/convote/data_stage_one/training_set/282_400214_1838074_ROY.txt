mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman from oregon for yielding me this time , and for her leadership on this very important issue . 
this is a very important step to deal with what is said to be up to 80 percent of the source of methamphetamines in our country . 
if you look at law enforcement , they are doing a wonderful job fighting the crime in their local communities . 
but this is something where they can not reach beyond the borders . 
it is only us in the federal government that can do that . 
we need to have the state department fully supportive , having the resources they need to go after the methamphetamines coming in from other countries . 
this amendment will do that . 
it is an important step forward . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment . 
i thank again the gentlewoman for her leadership on this .
