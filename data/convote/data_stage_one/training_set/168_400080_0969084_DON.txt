mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , but we are trying to get rid of criminals from coming into the country , and what the gentleman is doing in this amendment is keeping them in the country . 
in other words , deporting them is not good enough . 
we want to keep them in our prison systems , which now house more citizens , and now , we are adding noncitizens to the population of those incarcerated in america . 
and i have some reservations about piling it on . 
we have never talked about this position before in the subcommittee or full committee of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time to make that observation .
