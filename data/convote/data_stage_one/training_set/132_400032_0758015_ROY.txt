madam speaker , i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. gohmert ) xz4006510 for participating with us tonight . 
he is exactly right . 
the estimate is that 500 , 000 new jobs will be created over the next year by the changes made in the energy policy for this nation . 
as i close this time that i have had tonight , i do want to certainly draw some attention to provisions of the bill , and tomorrow we hope that everyone is going to be able to talk with us and work with us as we go through the bill . 
and we are going to address so many things not only with our small business , but we are going to hear about electricity transmission and capability and reliability of our nation 's electricity and the electrical sources . 
everyone was concerned , and we all are , when we hear of brownouts and blackouts and the series of blackouts over the past decade . 
so electricity is something that we will be addressing . 
i yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms. foxx ) xz4006430 for her comments on the bill .
