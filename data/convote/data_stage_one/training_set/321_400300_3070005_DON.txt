yes , i do , mr. speaker . 
mr. speaker , the last motion sought to increase funding for the low income heating assistance program by $ 2 billion and fully pay for that with an offset on the revenue side of the ledger . 
the gentleman from ohio did raise a point of order against that . 
we would have preferred to fully fund the amendment , but given the fact that the majority has chosen to exercise its rights under the rules of the house to raise a point of order , this is the only remaining avenue that we have to try to increase funding for low income heating assistance , recognizing that there is indeed an emergency ; and we would simply ask that the amount of money for low income heating assistance be increased by $ 2 billion and recognized as emergency funding under the budget act so
