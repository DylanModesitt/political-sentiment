mr. chairman , reserving the right to object , and i will not object , mr. chairman , simply to say that the gentleman has cleared this with the majority . 
it would change the numerical number of cities that would be eligible , but it would not change the total funding , and this is an acceptable change , and we are very willing to accept it . 
mr. chairman , i withdraw my reservation of objection .
