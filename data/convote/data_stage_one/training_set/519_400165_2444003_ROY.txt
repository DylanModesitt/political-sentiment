and that is just no answer to folks who are startled when they go to gas their vehicle , 50 bucks , 60 bucks , $ 70 to fill it up .

it will do nothing to help diversify our domestic refining capacity away from the gulf coast . 
it will do nothing to help site crude oil and petroleum product pipelines that transport gasoline to americans . 
it will do nothing to help small refineries utilize their capacity to increase supply and encourage robust competition in the industry .
