mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. reyes ) xz4003370 for bringing us these two amendments . 
again , these are for national security emergency issues , border patrol agents at our border . 
i represent all the california-mexico border . 
i know that we need these agents . 
the president asked for them , and yet he did not put the money in to pay for them . 
in addition , every veterans group and the va itself say to complete the year , giving the services they need , they need another $ 1.3 billion . 
this is truly an emergency . 
the rules that will be used once again to say that our national defense at the border , our veterans to get their adequate health care , somehow we violate the rules , but let us not violate common sense . 
common sense says we need these funds . 
we need this protection . 
we need these services for our veterans . 
let us dispense with the technical objections and fund what we need for our veterans and for our border defense .
