mr. chairman , for the balance of my time i would like my friend , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. regula ) xz4003340 , the chairman of the subcommittee , to engage me in a brief colloquy . 
mr. chairman , as i mentioned before , i intend to withdraw this amendment , but i hope this is an issue with which we can work as this bill moves through the process . 
ryan white funds and the aids drug assistance programs provide critical assistance to our communities and our states , and they need further flexibility to expend expiring ryan white care act funds . 
i would ask the chairman if he would work with me in this regard .
