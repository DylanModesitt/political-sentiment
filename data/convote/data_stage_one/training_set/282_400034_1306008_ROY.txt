mr. speaker , i believe we will do those in the order that they appeared starting on tuesday . 
so i would expect tuesday 's work to include the science , commerce , state , justice appropriations act , and then move on to defense appropriations on wednesday if we are completed with the previous bill , and then to bring the bill to the floor on united nations reform after that .
