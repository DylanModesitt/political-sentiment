madam speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume before calling on the gentlewoman from pennsylvania . 
i want to point out , madam speaker , to the gentleman from florida , my good friend , regarding this particular legislation , s. 397 , we have in this body , not just in the 109th this year , passed very , very similar , almost identical legislation , and there were some 11 amendments i think offered during the markup in the committee on the judiciary . 
those were defeated . 
in fact , at least one member of the committee from the other party , from the minority party , voted against most of those amendments and voted in favor of favorably reporting this bill . 
this bill also was passed in the 108th congress , h.r. 1036 . 
i think the vote on that particular bill was 285 to 140 . 
madam speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ( ms. hart ) xz4001680 , a member of the committee on the judiciary .
