i wanted to say to the gentlewoman , first , i very much appreciate the thrust of her amendment . 
while we are prepared to accept her amendment , let me add to that there could be some resistance , perhaps , on the part of the state department . 
if there is resistance , it is because they have never seen fit to apply the existing law to overseas contracts . 
i think that is a small mistake on their part , frankly , if they have not . 
i think the gentlewoman is not just raising an important point but a point that needed to be made .
