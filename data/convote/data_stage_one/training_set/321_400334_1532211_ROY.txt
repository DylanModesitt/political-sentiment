mr. chairman , i move to strike the last words . 
mr. chairman , we oppose this amendment . 
there is already language in the public broadcasting act of 1967 that prevents the corporation for public broadcasting from controlling the content of public broadcasting services . 
i do not see why this language is necessary today . 
the law is already there . 
you have different points of view as to what is the characteristics of public broadcasting , and that is conservative , liberal or whatever . 
i think this amendment is unnecessary in light of current law . 
let cpb do its job and stop trying to politicize it . 
i will point out one further thing . 
this amendment would negatively impact on cpb 's ability to assist in the production of quality educational programming . 
for example , if this amendment were to be law , if ken burns , whom we all are familiar with , were to serve as a consultant to the national park service on battlefield conservation , he then would be prohibited from producing any documentaries for pbs or local public tv stations . 
the amendment would alter public broadcasting 's authorization that is presently in the law , and i think it would cripple the abilities of cpb to do what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want it to do , and that is to be an objective medium , to present all sides of every issue , and not attempt to politicize the message . 
with the present law , it seems to me that there is no need for this amendment . 
i urge my colleagues to vote against it if we do have a roll call vote .
