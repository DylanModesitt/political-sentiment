mr. speaker , you know what we are trying to do here is to make health care more affordable , available and accessible to all americans . 
it seems to me that if we are going to achieve this goal , we have to adhere to some principles , and i can think of three right off the bat that are very important . 
one is to provide information to the consumer ; second , choices to the consumer ; and , thirdly , thirdly , control to the consumer . 
now , this amendment that is being proposed seems to me that it is going to limit choice rather than create choice . 
and i find it odd that there is no mention of what its cost is going to be to the federal government in putting forth these subsidies . 
i think we need to know that information . 
i think it is very important information . 
and it also seems to me that this program is going to add to the cost of health care , and not lower the cost . 
what we need to do is foster competition in health care , and right now 45 percent of all of the health care dollars are within governmental systems , medicare and medicaid and so forth . 
the other 55 percent is in the insurance market , and there is no competition . 
there is no competition in this arena . 
and so if we stick to these three principles i mentioned earlier , we can create competition . 
it seems to me that if we are going to give subsidies , why not give subsidies to individuals to buy health savings accounts which provide those choices which will allow for an information flow to the patient , to the consumer ? 
and so i urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to not support this amendment and to vote for h.r. 525 , which offers a good starting point to creating competition in the health care market .
