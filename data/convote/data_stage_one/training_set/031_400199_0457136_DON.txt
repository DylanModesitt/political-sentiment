mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . 
i want to rise as well to support the gentlewoman from new york 's amendment dealing with the efforts the unfpa is engaged in because we got a chance to see firsthand in visiting sri lanka the work that has been done . 
it is true that many children were lost . 
it is true that 15 , 000 , at the time that we were there , women were expecting ; and it is certainly true that they lost a large infrastructure of health care , particularly the women 's hospital that we were able to visit . 
the women 's maternity hospital was completely destroyed , and so these dollars will be crucial in helping to ensure good health care , good intervention , and safe deliveries . 
i want to commend all of the leadership that is focused on this particularly narrow issue , though it may seem . 
it is vital that we provide the support , and i would like to encourage our colleagues to support this amendment .
