mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i would just point out that the americorps members that would be reduced and perhaps eliminated serve 2 million children and youth in education-related programs , as i mentioned earlier , as mentors . 
they tutor children of prisoners and they train over 600 , 000 community volunteers . 
so it has a very powerful ripple effect throughout the community to have these americorps , most like young people , volunteers , seeking other people and training them to engage in service as mentors and so on . 
here you have two good programs , but , on balance , we have to at this juncture and with the limited resources we have , go with the americorps as opposed to adding more , in addition to the $ 100 million we already put in the program , for innovative education programs . 
mr. chairman , i urge members to oppose this amendment if it were to come to a vote . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
