mr. chairman , i thank my friend for yielding me this time , and let me just say what it is that got us here . 
i have listened to the arguments propounded by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle . 
we are here because , as the chairman of the judiciary said , it has taken longer to complete this fence than it did to win the second world war . 
the problem that we have is , there needs to be recognition that the environmentally sound vote is to complete this fence . 
the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 held up a poster . 
if you look at where the fence has been completed , it is pristine , it is clean , it looks great , and it is securing our borders . 
if you look at that 3 1/2 -mile gap , you see all kinds of trash and devastation and you , of course , exacerbate the pressure with the flow of people coming into this country illegally , creating a wide range of problems . 
we came this close , when we had strong support , 257 members of this body in the last congress who voted for the ose amendment that should have been included in the 9/11 committee 's recommendation in the conference agreement that we had . 
the other body prevented us when we were working in the conference to bring it back here . 
we had indications from democrats and republicans alike that if we brought this measure up we could have strong support of it . 
it is imperative , it is imperative that we complete this fence . 
smugglers gulch is an area which is , i believe , posing a very serious threat to our stability in this country and in california . 
so i urge my colleagues to oppose the farr amendment and cast the environmentally sound vote , which is a `` no '' vote .
