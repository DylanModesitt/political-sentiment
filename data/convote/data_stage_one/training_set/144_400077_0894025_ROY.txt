mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i want to quickly respond to a couple of points that my good friend made . 
first , i would remind him that we did not pay for world war ii or korea or vietnam out of current revenue . 
it is not unusual to finance wars in this particular fashion . 
second , as to the point on the embassy , i have been to iraq four times and have met with our folks there and , frankly , i think they deserve the very best protection they can get as quick as we can get it . 
they are every bit as much at risk as people that wear the uniform of the united states . 
they are all volunteers . 
they have done a wonderful job representing our country . 
they deserve and need a safe place to operate out of . 
i am very glad that that particular measure was put back in during conference . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
