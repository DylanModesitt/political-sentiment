mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me . 
the gentleman from new york is absolutely correct in that there was an oversight in that state and local courts would not be eligible for the four grant programs that the gentleman outlined in his remarks . 
this amendment corrects the oversight , and i am happy to support it and hope that the committee adopts it .
