mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
in response , and of course i have nothing but utmost respect for the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 , and it is a pleasure for me to support your amendment , and all three of the distinguished gentlemen that spoke bring up a good point . 
the secretary of state does need flexibility , and that is why in this amendment i provided flexibility . 
if the secretary of state certifies that there has been such a change in the regime attitudewise , personnelwise , that he or she firmly believes that the next session they will be voting with us more than half the time , then that makes an exception , and they will get funding .
