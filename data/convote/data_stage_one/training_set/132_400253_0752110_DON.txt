madam chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
here is the problem with the bush administration . 
the congress , over the years , has passed any number of regulations that deal with the issue of appliance efficiency , but the bush administration is allergic to energy efficiency . 
it just wants to put a big new gas station on top of the arctic wilderness or on top of any other pristine area in our country rather than looking at the technological genius of our country to find some way of improving our efficiency . 
so even with regard to new standards in this manager 's amendment , they give this administration 6 years , 6 years , to come up with new standards , even as the bush administration has not done anything for the first 5 years of its term of office at the height of an energy crisis , knowing the consequence of all of this pollution going into the atmosphere in terms of its impact upon the health of our country . 
my colleagues , just so you know , women in japan contract breast cancer at only one-fifth the rate of american women . 
women in japan contract breast cancer at only one-fifth the rate of american women . 
women in japan contract breast cancer at only one-fifth the rate of american women . 
after the family comes to america from japan , they contract it at the same rate as americans . 
that means it is not in the genes of the girls ; it means it is in our air , it is in our water . 
what this amendment does is , it says we are just going to build a couple hundred more large electrical generating plants , coal and natural gas , and just spew it into the atmosphere . 
well , that is going to be breathed in , all that mercury , all that sulfur and nitrous oxide , and it is going to have a dramatically negative impact upon the health of our country . 
my colleagues , this is a bad amendment , and i really regret it is out here and that my friend has proposed it .
