mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
the gentleman 's amendment actually does not go quite far enough , but he has a germaneness problem . 
what he really wants to do is abolish hud , given his philosophy . 
he does not think there should be a federal housing program . 
since he can not get at hud , he goes after fannie and freddie in ways that would reduce substantially what we do in housing . 
and , by the way , the administration 's objection to this bill is not , as says the gentleman , that it is too much regulation . 
it is that we do not give the regulator enough powers . 
so the administration 's position is somewhat opposite to the gentleman from texas ' , not for the first time , to his credit . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida ( ms. wasserman schultz ) .
