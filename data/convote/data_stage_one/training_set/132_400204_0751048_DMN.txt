mr. speaker , i thank my colleague for allowing me to take some time . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying bill . 
in a desire to pass any comprehensive energy bill , some of my colleagues may be willing to overlook the massive damage that this bill would do to our existing clean air policies . 
i do not blame the energy companies for ignoring their responsibility . 
it is our responsibility to protect the people as the people 's representatives against dangers . 
as a matter of fact , i acknowledge and applaud txu and ups for their efforts in the right direction in north texas , but section 1443 of h.r. 6 would give polluters in dirty-air areas extra time to continue polluting . 
under the existing act , areas that have unhealthy air are required to reduce ozone-forming smog pollution by set statutory deadlines . 
section 1443 would delay the adoption of urgently needed anti-pollution measures in communities throughout this country for a decade or more . 
my amendments presented to the committee on rules would have corrected this or would have also given some time for the companies to record their progress ; but , of course , they were not made in order . 
my colleagues will hear that the epa does not disapprove of this . 
well , is anybody surprised ? 
these are the people who were appointed by the same people that allowed the energy companies to write most of this bill . 
this provision will mean more asthma attacks , hospital visits , and premature deaths for residents of the ozone odor nonattainment areas which includes the area that all my great friends over here live in and i live in . 
we need a fair bill that addresses the urgent need for clean air for ourselves and our children . 
mr. speaker , prolonging our dirty air problem is not the solution . 
i urge my colleagues that desire clean air for themselves and their constituents to oppose this rule and oppose this bill . 
i am from an energy-producing state .
