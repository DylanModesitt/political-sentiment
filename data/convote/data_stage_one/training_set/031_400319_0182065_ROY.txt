mr. chairman , during the debate of the real id act of 2005 , of which i am a co-sponsor , i was unavoidably detained and unfortunately missed the opportunity to vote on the amendment offered by representative jerrold nadler . 
if i would have been present , i would have voted a resounding `` no '' against this amendment . 
the nadler amendment would have stricken the provision in the real id act that tightens and improves our asylum system , which has been abused by terrorists with deadly consequences . 
the real id act will protect the american people by allowing immigration judges to determine witness credibility in asylum cases and ensuring that all terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility are also grounds for deportation . 
in summary , as a co-sponsor of this bill , i believe that all of the provisions in the real id act are essential in protecting our citizens from future terrorist plots and i would have voted `` no '' on the nadler amendment .
