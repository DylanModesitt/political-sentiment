mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , we are in opposition to the amendment . 
there is no universal mental health screening in this bill . 
secretary leavitt has made it clear there is nothing like this under consideration . 
it is an amendment that is not needed because it addresses a problem that does not exist . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
