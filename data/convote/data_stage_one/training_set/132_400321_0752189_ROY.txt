mr. chairman , i rise in support of this bipartisan amendment . 
if we want a national energy policy that is truly about economic security for all americans , not just those in the auto industry , that is about national security for all americans , it needs to be comprehensive . 
it needs to be about hybrid vehicles , alternative fuels , renewable fuels . 
it needs to be about better using our resources we have . 
but it also needs to be about conservation . 
this amendment is one of the greatest steps we can take in the area of going forward in conservation . 
it is not about whether you should be able to buy an suv . 
it is about whether you should be able to buy an suv that gets 27.5 miles per gallon like a car does instead of 20.7 . 
it is about choice and efficiency . 
this amendment is a good amendment . 
i urge a `` yes '' vote . 
i commend the prime sponsors of the amendment for bringing it before the house .
