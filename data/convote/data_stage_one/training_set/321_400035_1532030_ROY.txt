mr. chairman , the arts motivate and inspire people of all ages to engage in learning , and that is what this is all about . 
students who take regular arts courses are proven to score on average 90 to 100 points better on their sats than students that do not take arts classes . 
students that attend arts courses are shown to have better attendance , lower dropout rates , participate in more community service and have a higher self-esteem . 
that sounds to me like a pretty darn good investment in the youth of america . 
mr. chairman , i urge support of this amendment .
