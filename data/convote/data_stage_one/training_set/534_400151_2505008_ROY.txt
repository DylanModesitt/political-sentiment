mr. speaker , in response to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 i want to point out that this bill prohibits lawsuits against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm or ammunition or not-for-profit trade association for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition . 
but it provides , as i said in my opening remarks , mr. speaker , five exceptions to this liability protection , including , and i will just mention one in response to my good friend from massachusetts . 
an exception would be for an action against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence , per se , for example supplying a gun or ammunition to a person when the seller knows or reasonably should know that the buyer possesses an unacceptable risk of physical injury to himself or others . 
as an example again , the d.c . 
snipers were successful in court on these grounds .
