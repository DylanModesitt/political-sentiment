mr. chairman , i want to speak in favor of this . 
i have spent 15 years here trying to develop alternative sources of energy so we are not victimized by oil . 
we have a safe extractive method here with natural gas . 
we have encouraged it . 
we want to get to alternative energies . 
this is one of the alternative energies , and it has a direct effect on the working people of this country . 
i will tell my colleagues , i think this is a jobs issue . 
this is a blue collar issue . 
this is a family issue in terms of bringing down prices and getting a safe supply of fuel for this country . 
if we do not get into this kind of alternative , we are going to be struck forever in rhetoric and not being able to produce for our people , not just fuel but produce it in a way that is truly alternative and within the bounds of people 's budgets . 
that is why we need to support this amendment .
