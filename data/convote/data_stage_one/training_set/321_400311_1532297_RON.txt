mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 1/2 minutes . 
let me assure members that you are misconstruing the amendment . 
it is as if we are banning screening . 
that is not the case . 
i am just saying screening everybody is what i am trying to prevent . 
if there is one person out of 100 , 000 that commits suicide , why are members compelled to have a program that may test 99 , 999 people ? 
this does nothing to the individual that shows the problem . 
you can still test them , preferably with parental consent . 
let me add that the gentleman from ohio stated that the vote went against this amendment last year . 
this came up at the last minute . 
let me tell members , people in this country have been well informed about this , and they do not like this program . 
i also would like to quote from the new freedom commission because it is true the new freedom commission , which is the guideline the gentleman from ohio brought up ; he brings it up , he cites what it says , so they have some value . 
they never say `` mandatory , '' but they never say `` voluntary. '' what they say is `` universal. '' how can you have something universal if you are not going to be testing everybody ? 
also from the freedom commission , it should be for consumers of all ages , screen for mental disorders in primary health care across the life span . 
these are the guidelines of the new freedom commission , as well as saying the schools must be partners in the mental health care of our children . 
why do they not say the parents should be partners in the health care of our children ?
