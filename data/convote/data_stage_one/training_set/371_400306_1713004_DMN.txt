mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to make my comments on this bill very briefly . 
essentially , h.r. 741 weakens the fundamental policy of the secretary of labor while enhancing the powers of the osha commission . 
such action would create two divided regulators and a great deal of confusion . 
the secretary of labor is best able to regulate and enforce safety standards , and as such , the authority should remain with her . 
this is just plain common sense . 
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on h.r. 741 . 
we do not need more confusion . 
more confusion is only a way to trivialize and make osha less effective . 
mr. speaker , i would like to turn my attention to an issue that should be of great concern to all members of this body in relation to this particular subject , and that is worker deaths and serious injuries . 
between 5 , 000 and 6 , 000 american workers are killed on the job every year by willful and negligent safety violations on the part of errant employers . 
i have talked about that already . 
the surviving family members killed by corporate wrongdoing deserve much more than just our sympathy , however . 
they deserve immediate congressional attention and action . 
instead of considering these bills to weaken osha , we should be strengthening provisions of the occupational safety and health act . 
we should be considering a bill like h.r. 2004 , the protecting america 's workers act , which i introduced on april 28 to coincide with workers ' memorial day , a day set aside every year to honor workers killed on the job by safety violations . 
joining me as cosponsors of h.r. 2004 are the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. andrews ) xz4000080 , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. lynch ) xz4002490 , the gentlewoman from connecticut ( ms. delauro ) xz4001030 , the gentleman from maine ( mr. michaud ) xz4002740 , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. woolsey ) xz4004360 , the gentleman mr. speaker , i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from ohio ( ms. kaptur ) xz4002110 to give us an example of the seriousness of the situation .
