mr. chairman , i have looked at the amendment , and i understand what the gentlewoman is talking about , what her intentions or how it would be used in the tsunami recovery fund . 
it does not , of course , specifically provide for that , and i am prepared to accept this amendment if the gentlewoman would be willing to move the discussion along as quickly as possible .
