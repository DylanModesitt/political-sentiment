mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words , and i rise to oppose the amendment . 
i have to say what i say about the administration , about the defense department many times . 
just because you say it , does not mean it is so . 
just because we say we are going to put $ 5 million in does not mean it is going to be a truman commission . 
we have bill language which says they have to report to us at a certain date , and they did not do it . 
so there is no doubt in my mind this is not something that is going to happen . 
i do not say we are wasting time because there is no question accountability is our responsibility . 
but we are not going to get any responsibility this way . 
as far as i am concerned , what we are saying , this language is not bill language . 
it does not mean that they are going to do it . 
and so i oppose the amendment . 
and i think we ought to get rid of this amendment and get on with the rest of the business on the floor .
