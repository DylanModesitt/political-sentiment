mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment which continues to have endless litigation against plugging the hole in the fence south of san diego . 
we were able to win world war ii quicker than we were able to complete this fence . 
i think that shows why this amendment is a bad one . 
i want to tell the membership the short story that illustrates why the fence has to be completed . 
in early january , i sent two of my staff personally to inspect this area . 
on the day they visited the imperial beach station at the border patrol , they asked to see a demonstration of the afis fingerprint system used to identify criminal aliens among those caught across the border . 
a man picked at random from a holding area of high-risk detainees , who had been apprehended the night before , was selected for fingerprint check . 
within 15 minutes the system returned a rap sheet that was 17 pages long . 
crimes he committed across three different states included abusing his spouse , raping his daughter and multiple counts of theft . 
this man was apprehended not far from smuggler 's gulch and came through the area where the fence is not complete . 
the border patrol says he is typical of the one in three aliens they apprehend coming through the 3-mile unfenced area along the beach . 
this person is a criminal , and membership of the california delegation complained about the cost of california incarcerating criminal aliens . 
we can cut down that cost and incarcerate fewer criminal aliens by plugging the hole in this fence and keeping them south of the border . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
