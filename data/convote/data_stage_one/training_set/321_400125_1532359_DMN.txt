mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 3010 , the departments of labor , health and human services and education fiscal year 2006 appropriations act . 
h.r. 3010 severely under funds education , health care , and job training efforts that are crucial to north carolina and to the country . 
as the only former state schools chief serving in congress , i know firsthand the devastating effects that these education cuts will have . 
at a time when we are asking our schools to do more than ever , these education cuts will destroy the morale of our teachers , parents and students . 
not only does this appropriations bill continue to under fund no child left behind , but it also shortchanges special education for 6.9 million children , fails to raise the maximum pell grant and eliminates successful education initiatives like drop out prevention . 
these education cuts will make it impossible for our schools to meet high standards of accountability . 
unfortunately , h.r. 3010 also fails to provide adequate funds for key health care programs . 
in rural communities it is often hard to find a doctor , and emergency rooms can be dangerously far away . 
this appropriations bill slashes funding for rural and preventative health . 
activities that would be terminated include initiatives designed to encourage new medical and dental school graduates to choose primary care specialties and to practice in rural and urban under-served areas . 
i am also concerned about the inadequate funding for preventative health block grants and community health centers , both of which provide much needed services to the people of north carolina 's 2nd district . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to vote against this bad bill .
