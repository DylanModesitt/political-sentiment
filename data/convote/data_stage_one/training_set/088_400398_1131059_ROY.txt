madam chairman , i thank the distinguished gentleman from arizona for yielding . 
i certainly agree that pilt is a necessary funding item . 
we have added $ 30 million to it . 
i agree with the gentleman that we will make every effort to do so as we move to conference with the senate . 
as the gentleman from wisconsin mentioned a moment ago , when you go to the senate , you can not always control what happens . 
we will certainly stand by our statements to decrease the spending on land if we can manage that , and we will count on the house to support us in that area . 
but i do thank the gentleman for calling this to our attention , and we certainly support what he is thinking about .
