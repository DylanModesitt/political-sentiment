mr. chairman , the gentleman is very kind . 
mr. chairman , i will tell you the ncic system works . 
after 6 1/2 years , it is overdue time we tried to do something about the visas . 
i will take just a minute to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for a great bill . 
i appreciate so much his support in this , as well as the support of the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) xz4001540 and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. wolf ) xz4004350 and all their good work . 
we are finally , finally trying to do something about this terrible problem of illegal immigrants .
