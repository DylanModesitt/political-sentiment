mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
let me applaud the author and the ranking member and the chair of this committee for addressing the issue of gangs . 
i do not agree with all of the approach , but i do agree we need to address the issue , and i rise today to speak about the creation of databases to track gang activity . 
in addition to developing a solid gang prevention strategy , we must equip our law enforcement professionals with the tools to protect our communities . 
recently , law enforcement in dallas spoke to me regarding their desire to track gang activity . 
i work closely with the law enforcement divisions in my area , and they wanted a system that would allow them to easily access and share information on gang activity . 
i am offering an amendment that will do just that . 
this database will contain critical information on gangs , gang members , firearms , criminal activities and histories , vehicles , and other fields of information necessary for investigators to solve gang-related crimes . 
in addition , it will allow law enforcement to track the movement of gangs and members throughout the country , coordinate police response to gang violence , and enhance officer safety . 
this system is a fundamental step in combating future gang violence . 
i ask my colleagues for their support for this important amendment .
