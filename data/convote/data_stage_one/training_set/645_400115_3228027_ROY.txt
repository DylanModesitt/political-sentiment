mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to respond to my friend . 
i will simply say that i believe we should do everything we can to pursue the deliberative process here . 
i believe that the rules committee does that . 
we have a management responsibility . 
we bring resolutions through the rules committee . 
if there is controversy , i believe that recognizing our strategy for victory in iraq is the right thing to do . 
people in iraq , our men and women on the ground , recognize that . 
i believe it is the right thing to do and i look forward to a strong and overwhelming bipartisan vote in support of this resolution . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
