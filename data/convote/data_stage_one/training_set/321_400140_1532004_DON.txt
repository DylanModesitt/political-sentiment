mr. chairman , i thank the chairman of the subcommittee for yielding . 
mr. chairman , i have been concerned about a program known as youth build , which i know many members are familiar with , which is a very good program which gets young people in urban areas and elsewhere to learn how to build houses . 
and the results are some very nice houses for deserving people , and an improvement of a neighborhood , and most importantly , skills for these young people . 
now , we ran into a little difficulty . 
it is not one of the more expensive of our programs although it has been , at $ 60 million , not nothing . 
the president in his budget proposed i think $ 50 million for it , but proposed that instead of being funded out of the hud budget it be transferred to the labor department 's budget . 
that led to , i guess , it falling between the cracks of the two appropriate subcommittees ; so that while i understand there is support for the program and the gentleman from new york ( mr. walsh ) xz4004200 , a former chairman of the hud subcommittee , tells me that he strongly supports it , and i understand there was a very close vote in the appropriations committee on an amendment to put it back into the bill , both bills now come to the floor so i would ask the chairman of the subcommittee , given the , i believe , support , it was in the president 's budget , there was virtually a tie vote in the appropriations committee , could the gentleman tell me , is there some hope that we can give to these young people that this important program will survive ?
