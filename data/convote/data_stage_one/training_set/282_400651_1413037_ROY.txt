mr. speaker , i am proud to rise in support of the rule and the henry j. hyde u.n . 
reform act , and just as proud to rise in tribute to the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 . 
when the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 feels something needs fixing , we had better take notice and know it needs fixing . 
we need an organization of nations that cares about human rights , but we need a united group of nations that believes more in the rights of individuals than it believes that the right of individuals is to plunder others . 
it should be noticed that at a time when the united nations ' reputation for truth , justice , and following its own rules is at an all-time low , it should be doing everything it can to bring information to light , whether it is good or bad . 
if the u.n . 
leadership , however , spent half the time lining the fabric of freedom than it has been lining the pockets of friends and family , then this would be approaching utopia . 
that is not the case . 
last month there was an investigator who had something called a conscience . 
he wanted to come forward with information . 
what did the u.n . 
do ? 
they hired attorneys to have an injunction to keep us from knowing the truth . 
it is time to be united and holding the united nations accountable . 
support the rule on the henry h. hyde bill .
