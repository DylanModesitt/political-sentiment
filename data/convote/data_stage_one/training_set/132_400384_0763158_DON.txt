mr. chairman , i rise to support the hastings amendment . 
california law , back in 1996 , we passed this particular amendment , and i carried that bill . 
it was one of the first in this country . 
now there are 29 states that are enforcing this . 
under the energy bill , this provision is necessary because they will be able to put refineries , be able to go onto native americans lands , they will be able to go into communities of color , in low-income communities like mine that are underserved right now , that have many , many egregious projects that are there that are polluting our waters , and making our life , i think , a health hazard . 
this is the wrong direction to go in with the energy bill . 
we need to support this amendment for environmental justice when right now , under the bush administration , 33 percent of ej moneys have been cut .
