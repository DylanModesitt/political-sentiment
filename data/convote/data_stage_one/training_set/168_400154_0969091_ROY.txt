in virginia , recent gang victims have been hacked by machetes and had fingers cut off . 
in may 2004 , a 16-year-old boy in fairfax county had several fingers chopped off in an attack by a machete-wielding assailant . 
a week later , a 17-year-old youth was shot dead in herndon by an assailant on a bicycle . 
in july 17 , 2003 , in shenandoah county , virginia , ms-13 gang members violently murdered a 17-year-old pregnant federal witness , brenda paz , before she could testify in a pending federal trial in the eastern district of virginia against ms-13 .

i urge my colleagues to support the amendment .
