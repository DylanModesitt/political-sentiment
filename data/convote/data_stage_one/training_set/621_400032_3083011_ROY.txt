if the gentleman will yield , let us talk about some of these provisions that are in the bill that is going to be before us . 
because we do not want the democrat tax increase to take place , and that is why the leadership in this house is working to be certain that we pass our tax relief extension reconciliation act . 
and if individuals are going to go on and look at this , it is house resolution 4297 . 
i think they would like to see some of the provisions that are in here . 
the gentleman from texas and i have worked long and hard on one provision which is in here , which is continued deductibility of state and local sales taxes from your federal income tax filing . 
in my state of tennessee that is something that is mighty important , because we are one of those great states that does not have a state income tax . 
we have fought hard in tennessee to be sure that we stay income-tax free , and we are . 
we want to continue this deduction . 
it is a deduction that we worked hard last year to get restored , and we thank another gentleman from texas , mr. brady , for his incredible leadership on this issue , and we thank the leadership of the house for working so closely with us on it . 
but that sales tax deductibility is something we encourage everyone in this body , everyone who is in a state that does not have a state income tax to support this legislation tomorrow because it is so important to the individuals in our states . 
it is estimated that in tennessee this is worth about $ 1 billion a year to the state of tennessee .
