mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
all i can tell the gentleman is , i know there is a lot of discussion about that over in the senate . 
i do not know what their resolution is , even if there is a resolution on the senate side . 
the house , as the gentleman knows , passed the budget that has substantial mandatory savings in it . 
the house is very interested in holding the line on their mandatory savings , and the senate is trying to work through this process . 
so it is really up to the senate as to what they are going to bring to the conference .
