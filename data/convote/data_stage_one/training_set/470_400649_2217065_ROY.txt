mr. chairman , i agree exactly with what the gentleman just said , and that is why i am voting for the underlying bill . 
but the gentleman said earlier that this is some kind of voluntary registration . 
there is nothing voluntary about this . 
we , in strong action here , are requiring exactly the person he just described to register , and we say to them they must register within the prescribed period . 
there is no voluntary nature to that . 
that is a strong and good law . 
that is what we are doing here . 
the question is whether we can trust the sentencing guidelines and the sentencing commission and federal judges to come up with a system to figure out whether that person that the gentleman is describing , flagrantly violating it , should go off for 20 years as opposed to the hypothetical that i posed as somebody in confusion about when exactly they moved , let us say , from california to florida , as to whether that case deserves a mandatory minimum of 5 years . 
because what we are doing here , if this amendment fails , is tying the hands of that judge in ohio such that he must or she must send the person off for 5 years if there was confusion about when and how they moved to the state of ohio . 
it may be somebody who did not flagrantly violate . 
it was just confusion as to when they moved . 
and if we have sentencing guidelines and judges that follow those guidelines , if they do not , put pressure on them and then impeach them .
