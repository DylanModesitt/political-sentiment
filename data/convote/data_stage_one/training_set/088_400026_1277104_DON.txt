mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman from connecticut for yielding me this time . 
i certainly think that of all the discussions we have had on this floor , everyone on both sides of the aisle has nothing but the best intentions , and i respect that . 
i think that as we move forward in the protection of our food supply , it is important for us not to burden an industry with requirements and costs that go above and beyond what is necessary for us to protect the public health and safety . 
i think that this bill goes too far when it absolutely requires mandatory labeling of the products . 
i think that we can do this on a voluntary basis , give our producers the right to put the label that they wish as far as the origin of their product on their product , and put it on the grocery store shelf and see what happens . 
we have no indication that just labeling the country of origin makes a significant difference in the marketing of these products , and i think it is an unnecessary extra layer of regulation that we are about to put on an industry that many times has a very difficult time staying in business anyway . 
i rise in opposition to this amendment and recognize that everyone on both sides of the issue has nothing but the best of intentions and certainly wishes the industry well and especially our grass-roots producers . 
we want to do what is necessary to help them all we can . 
but i still would encourage a `` no '' vote on this amendment and look forward to seeing this issue at some date , maybe long after i am gone from this place , resolved , because it has been around a long time .
