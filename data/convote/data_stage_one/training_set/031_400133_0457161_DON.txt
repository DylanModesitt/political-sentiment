madam chairman , i understand what the chairman is saying . 
i have been around here long enough . 
i do not have confidence in that regular order . 
i know what is going to happen then . 
then we will be accused of legislating on appropriations or some other rule will be brought up . 
so i do not accept the ruling . 
i intend to challenge the ruling , and i think we owe this to our veterans .
