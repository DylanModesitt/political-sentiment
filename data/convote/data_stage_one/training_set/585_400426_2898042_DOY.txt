mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
this is a technical amendment that fixes an oversight in the bill that left out four programs that would be helpful for courts , court officers , and court security personnel to take advantage of : the bulletproof vest partnership grant program ; the byrne memorial state and local law enforcement assistance discretionary grant program ; the assistance for children 's justice act , cja , grants ; and state justice statistics program for statistical analysis centers . 
these four grant programs , i think , the authors of the bill , mr. gohmert , myself and members of the committee , had intended to be available to courts as a result of this bill , and this amendment would include those .
