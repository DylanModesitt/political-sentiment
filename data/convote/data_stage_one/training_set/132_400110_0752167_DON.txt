mr. chairman , i know the amendment is offered with the best of good will . 
it is nonetheless a bad amendment which is going to cost this country jobs . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose it . 
the amendment appears to say that it would only require cafe to be fixed at 33 . 
in point of fact , it would be required , because of the language in the amendment , to properly go to 36 miles per gallon . 
if you like driving around in small cars , this will assure that that will be all that you will have . 
i will point out who opposes it : afl-cio , farm bureau , united auto workers , national automobile dealers , and hundreds of consumers who buy comfortable cars which are big enough so that they can take their family around . 
the amendment would purport to have the agency which would fix fuel economy standards to in fact consider both jobs , safety and other questions like that . 
in point of fact , there is no requirement . 
so those requirements , in fact , are not requirements but , rather , an illusion . 
i would urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment . 
it is opposed by people who want jobs , who are concerned about the economic welfare and well being of the country , and the auto workers . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
