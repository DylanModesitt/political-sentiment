mr. chairman , my amendment creates a national office of children 's safety within the department of justice , which would be run by a presidential appointment and would report to the attorney general . 
the director 's duties would be to track state compliance with new registration requirements in the bill and report back to congress on their progress . 
it would coordinate the federal government 's response to the sexual abuse of minors and provide expertise and resources for the unique crime of child sexual abuse to states , local , and federal authorities . 
it is important that this amendment , if accepted , be run by someone qualified for the job . 
the fema incident illustrates this part of the provision . 
the large number of sexually exploited children in this country is certainly an emergency . 
that is why i ask my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure our department of justice makes combating the exploitation of children one of its highest priorities .
