mr. speaker , i very much respect the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 ; we are friends and have been for 30 years . 
i voted for the bill that precipitated this debate . 
i voted with the gentleman for that bill . 
but this debate is not about that bill , and it is not about the issue of sexual predators . 
it is about whether or not we can trust each other to deal with each other with fairness and with accuracy . 
it is about whether or not the majority will use its power to unilaterally mischaracterize any effort by any member of the minority . 
i served a long time ago , and so did the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , with a fellow by the name of bill steiger . 
he was one of the great members in the history of this house . 
he spent a great deal of time trying to ensure that the & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record accurately reflected what each and every member said and did on this house floor . 
i think we owe it to his memory and the memory of others who fought the same battle , to remember , as this resolution says , that it is the long and established practice in the house for reports to describe recorded votes with objective , nonargumentative captions . 
i agree with this resolution that the committee majority departed from that practice by captioning these five amendments with inflammatory captions . 
there is enough skill on the part of the majority staff of the judiciary committee to describe any amendment offered by any member in a non-pejorative , non-argumentative way . 
it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the language used was intended to hurt the member who offered it , not to provide an accurate description ; and i do think the committee owes the minority an apology .
