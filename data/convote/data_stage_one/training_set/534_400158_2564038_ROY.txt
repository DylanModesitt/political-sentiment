mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act . 
over the last few years , trial lawyers have filed suit against firearms manufacturers across the country in the hopes of bankrupting the industry . 
these frivolous lawsuits are often based on the dubious premise that gun manufacturers should be held liable for the actions of others who use their products in a criminal or unlawful manner . 
this abuse of the legal process demands strong congressional action , and we are responding with this legislation . 
this bill will protect the firearms industry from lawsuits based on the criminal or unlawful third-party misuse of their products . 
this law is necessary to prevent a few state courts from undermining our second amendment rights guaranteed by the constitution . 
contrary to many rumors , this bill will not prevent legitimate victims from having their day in court for cases involving defective firearms , breaches of contract , criminal behavior by a gun maker or dealer , or the negligent entrustment of a firearm to an irresponsible person . 
mr. speaker , while i have serious concerns about the trigger lock language added to this bill in the senate , the protection of lawful commerce in arms act is an important step in the right direction . 
the reality is that we need a bill to be signed into law , and this is our greatest opportunity to accomplish meaningful reform which benefits all lawful gun owners and enthusiasts . 
these irresponsible lawsuits seriously threaten the supply of guns and ammunition available for hunting , self-defense , collecting , competitive or recreational shooting , and other lawful activities , and it is time to put a stop to them .
