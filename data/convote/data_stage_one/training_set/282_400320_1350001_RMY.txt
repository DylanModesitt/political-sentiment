mr. speaker , the american people provide 22 percent of the u.n. 's budget , but the american people can not impact what happens at the u.n . 
for instance , the american people have no ability to force accountability in the billions stolen from the oil-for-food program . 
the american people have no way of objecting to the appointing of countries like syria , libya , north korea and cuba to the human rights commission . 
the american people have no way of pressuring kofi annan to resign or force prosecutions of peacekeepers who raped the very people they were ordered to protect . 
today , the u.n . 
operates with little or no oversight from its member states . 
we have an opportunity to change that with h.r. 2745 , which gives the american people the leveraging tool . 
by conditioning 50 percent of our u.n . 
dues to a series of reforms , the legislation would finally give the american people a voice on things like religious freedom , political oppression and abuses of power that have plagued the u.n . 
since its earliest days . 
i urge support .
