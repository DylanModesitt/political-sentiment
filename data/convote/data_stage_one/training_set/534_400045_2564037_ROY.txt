mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act . 
it is critical that the house once again pass this legislation in order to reduce the burden of unsubstantiated lawsuits and the infringement on our second amendment rights . 
when crimes are committed by a person using a firearm , i support tough sentencing guidelines as well as full and vigorous enforcement of all applicable laws . 
we must focus on the perpetrators of the crime , rather than frivolous lawsuits directed at gun manufacturers which will only restrict the rights of lawabiding citizens . 
the state of new hampshire has a long history of protecting individual rights and liberties . 
for millions of americans , and the many citizens of new hampshire , firearms provide protection for individuals and their families . 
i stand in support of this legislation and i will work to see that the second amendment right of our citizens to protect themselves will not be infringed upon .
