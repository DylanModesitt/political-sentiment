mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
the amendment increases payments in lieu of taxes $ 4.8 million and reduces the national endowment for the arts by $ 15 million . 
this interior bill is a balanced bill . 
in developing this bill , the committee made a number of difficult choices . 
if we had additional resources , i believe pilt would be a deserving program , as we have said over and over again here today . 
but to unbalance this bill at this time , i must rise in opposition . 
i encourage my colleagues to do the same thing . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
