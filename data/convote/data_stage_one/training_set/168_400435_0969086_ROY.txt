mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment . 
let me read an article from the washington post , `` in what officials suspect is the latest horror committed by gangs , 28 people , including six children , were killed december 24 when gunmen opened fire on a bus full of passengers near the northern honduran city of san pedro sula. '' twenty-eight individuals , six of them were children . 
another article said there was a request by the presidents of four central american countries for help in gang battles . 
the request came as u.s. authorities revealed that they had issued an alert for the suspected mastermind of the killing of these 28 people near san pedro sula . 
the individual is a suspected member of the ms-13 gang and may have already entered the united states illegally . 
the gentleman is right . 
that individual who was involved in the killing of 28 individuals in san pedro sula in honduras was arrested in mcallen , texas , coming back into the country after killing 28 people . 
i think the gentleman 's amendment is exactly right on target . 
there are many cases whereby they come back into the country and commit violent crimes after having committed violent crimes down in el salvador . 
but 28 people in that little village in that town of san pedro sula , and then the man is arrested not in honduras but up here in texas . 
with that , i just urge members to strongly support the amendment . 
it is very good .
