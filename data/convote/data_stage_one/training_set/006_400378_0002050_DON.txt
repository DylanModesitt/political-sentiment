mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i urge every member of this house to vote no on the previous question . 
if the previous question is defeated , i will offer an amendment to strike from the proposed rules package a provision that effectively guts our already ailing ethics process . 
this provision would halt the investigation of properly filed ethics complaints if , after 45 days , the chair and ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct have not set up an investigation committee . 
i urge the members on both sides of the aisle to vote no on this previous question so we can delete this offensive provision . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question .
