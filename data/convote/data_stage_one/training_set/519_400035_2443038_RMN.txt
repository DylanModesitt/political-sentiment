mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to this bill . 
h.r. 3893 will increase the deficit , harm the environment , undermine the states and give charity to oil companies , while doing virtually nothing , virtually nothing , to help consumers . 
the whole premise of this bill is faulty : refining capacity in u.s. is increasing . 
let me repeat that : refining capacity in the u.s. is increasing , and it has been increasing for a decade . 
yes , the number of refineries has declined , but that is irrelevant . 
saying that we have less refining capacity today because we have fewer refineries is like saying that we have fewer crops today than we did in 1920 because fewer americans are farming . 
it just does not make sense . 
it does not pass the laugh test . 
not only that , the marketplace offers incentives , and plenty of them , for oil companies , all the incentives they need to build more refineries . 
they have record profits and demand for their products keeps increasing . 
refining capacity is likely to increase even more with or without this bill responding to the market demand . 
but with this bill , we burden taxpayers by sending their hard-earned tax dollars into the pockets of oil companies through rebates and special payments . 
with this bill , we interfere with environmental rules designed to improve public health . 
with this bill , we take away , take away , authority from the states and local governments . 
what we do not do with this bill is take any steps to reduce demand for oil , the only step that will actually reduce the price of gasoline , not to mention to make our nation more secure . 
i urge opposition . 
the priorities are all wrong .
