mr. speaker , i yield myself 35 seconds . 
mr. speaker , i am a friend of the internet . 
in fact , i sponsored legislation that would exempt bloggers from fec legislation . 
but the issue is how we draw the lines to balance . 
we do not exempt the internet from laws controlling child pornography ; we do not allow child pornography on the internet . 
we do not exempt the internet from consumer safety laws . 
we do not exempt the internet from intellectual property or copyright laws . 
we do not because we think those laws are important . 
we wrestle with the details of unavoidable and unintended consequences . 
why do we do the hard work of wading through the details ? 
because why would we do anything else ? 
why should we disregard the integrity of the political process ? 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from maine ( mr. allen ) xz4000070 .
