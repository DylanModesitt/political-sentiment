yes , mr. chairman . 
i make the point of order , as the chairman of the full committee has said on several occasions . 
i am more than sympathetic . 
he is more than sympathetic to some of these amendments . 
i especially feel that way with this amendment , given the fact that it deals with something that is very dear to me , the issue of border security . 
however , i would make a point of order against the amendment which is not the humdrum of little technicalities . 
this is the rules of the house . 
it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and , therefore , violates clause 2 of rule xxi . 
the rule states in pertinent part that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if in changing existing law it gives affirmative direction in effect . 
this amendment would do that , and i ask for a ruling from the chair .
