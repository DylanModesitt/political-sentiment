madam chairman , i rise to oppose the amendment . 
although i certainly understand and share the concerns that many members have about plant , pests and diseases that devastate crops and trees , i must say that we have done our absolute best to fund eradication and control of plant pests in the bill that you see before you today . 
funding includes , among other things , for the asian long-horn beetle , it is at $ 15.3 million . 
also , across the country , the glassy-winged sharpshooter , 24 million ; the emerald ash borer , 14 million ; citrus canker , $ 36 million , very important to our members in florida . 
and the list goes on . 
emerging plant pests alone are funded at over $ 100 million in this bill . 
in addition , tens of millions of dollars go to fund programs to stop medfly , the boll weevil , brucellosis , the gypsy moth , and many others . 
every member has some interest represented . 
and we have carefully balanced things out so that agriculture is best protected , and that is what we all want . 
those are the appropriated amounts , and when there is an emergency situation , the secretary has authority to use funds from the commodity credit corporation for eradication and control . 
for sudden oak death , an additional $ 9 million was approved this year , and requests are pending for 11 million for the emerald ash borer and $ 5 million for the glassy-winged sharpshooter . 
we are watching the use of emergency funds closely . 
there is no way that appropriated dollars substitute for the emergency funding that these agriculture emergencies demand . 
i am also very concerned about the amendment due to the offset proposed to cut the common computing environment . 
i do oppose this amendment once again and urge a `` no '' vote .
