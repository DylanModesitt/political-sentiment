mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
as the gentleman from illinois ( mr. jackson ) xz4001980 knows , i spoke in committee against this amendment which was then part of a larger amendment and these two were combined at that point . 
i made the point that i was not at all sure that this additional money was needed in darfur , sudan in light of the amount of money that is already in the 2005 bill and the amount of money that is in the supplemental for this region . 
however , i understand the gentleman from illinois ( mr. jackson ) xz4001980 feels very strongly about this . 
he and i traveled together to the darfur region . 
we saw the terrible , terrible suffering that the people there are going through . 
we are in complete agreement on our need to take every step that we can to provide not only for a peaceful solution in the area , but also to provide for humanitarian relief for the people who live in that region , and therefore i am prepared today with concurrence of the chairman of the committee to accept this en bloc amendment , and we will take a very good look at this in the conference with the senate and see where we are at that point . 
we will be a little bit further down the road and have some time to get a better handle on this at that point . 
i again want to commend the gentleman for his commitment , his dedication , his passion in offering this amendment today .
