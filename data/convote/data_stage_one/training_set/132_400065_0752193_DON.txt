mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the amendment and in opposition to the underlying legislation . 
we need to increase our fuel efficiency if the u.s. is ever going to get serious about our energy crisis . 
last year , mr. chairman , i voted for this energy bill because i thought we needed a national plan , but that was when oil was selling at $ 30 a barrel . 
this year , when oil is averaging $ 55 a barrel and gas prices are nearly $ 3 a gallon in some places , it is bad public policy to add to the national debt , borrowing the money to give to companies who are making record profits . 
the american people deserve better . 
i ask for an `` aye '' vote .
