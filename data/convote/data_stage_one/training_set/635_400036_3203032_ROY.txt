mr. speaker , i appreciate my colleague from washington for yielding me this time . 
and i appreciate the concern that my colleague from massachusetts has raised . 
now , if this bill was as bad as the gentleman has tried to define it , why would we bring it to the floor ? 
why would any member of this house seek to bring a bill to the floor that would hurt american workers ?
