mr. chairman , this is something that has been discussed since the committee acted and passed the legislation out , but we felt very strongly that this would be a good addition to the legislation because of the fact that so many of these gang members are illegal aliens who have re-entered the country after already having been deported and having committed crimes earlier . 
something needs to be done more than simple deportation when they come right back in and commit more crimes .
