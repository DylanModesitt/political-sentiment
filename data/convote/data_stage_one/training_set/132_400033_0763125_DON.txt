mr. chairman , three brief points . 
we are back here because of the obsession of the majority leader , the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 , to provide the relief to the oil companies . 
my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. waxman ) xz4004250 , said that this was one of several oxygenated options . 
that is what the chairman of the committee raised . 
he did not pick one of them . 
the second point is that we have not voted on this . 
the procedural vote that we had yesterday was without the focus from the cbo that this is , in fact , an unfunded mandate . 
the people of this chamber will be voting with the knowledge that if they do not approve the capps amendment , they will be imposing unfunded costs . 
last , but not least , it is obscene that we would be transferring these costs to local communities when we are giving billions to the oil companies under this bill , and they are already enjoying unprecedented profits . 
it is not fair . 
it is not right . 
i strongly urge the approval of the capps amendment .
