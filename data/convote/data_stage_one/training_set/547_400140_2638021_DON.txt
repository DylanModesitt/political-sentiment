mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. lewis ) xz4002401 . 
since this is a bill which in its form in the manager 's amendment would interfere with voter registration efforts , there can be no more appropriate speaker on our side than the gentleman from georgia , who , 40 years ago and more , literally risked his life to advance the rights of people to vote . 
and i do not think he will be deterred any more today than he was by bull connor .
