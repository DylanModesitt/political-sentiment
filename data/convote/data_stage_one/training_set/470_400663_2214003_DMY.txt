mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me this time , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , we are here today to consider the rule for h.r. 3132 , the children 's safety act of 2005 . 
this rule has a requirement that all amendments be preprinted in the & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record to be in order for today 's floor debate . 
while this rule is less restrictive than most rules we report out of the committee on rules , i must point out that it is not an open rule . 
it restricts the debate we will be able to have today on this bill by preventing members from offering any new amendments . 
for example , if a member came up with a good idea for an amendment today based upon the discussion , he or she would not be able to offer it . 
that is unfortunate , because the children 's safety act is important legislation that aims to protect our children and allow them to grow up unharmed and free from abuse , but it is not perfect . 
this legislation ties the hands of the judiciary . 
we must allow those most competent , the judge who has presided over the case , who has seen and heard from the victim , to determine the appropriate punishment . 
our judges are best positioned to hand down sentences that correspond with the crime committed . 
mr. speaker , it is our responsibility to create laws that protect our children from harm . 
mr. speaker , i have no further requests for time , and i yield back the balance of my time .
