i very much thank the gentleman for his leadership in the committee , and i thank him for his response . 
there is widespread support for the hudson river cleanup project , and i know the people i represent will be relieved to hear the chairman clarify that this report will in no way delay phase i or phase ii of the hudson river pcb cleanup . 
i would suggest that if the study does proceed , it should be focused on new developments and should address the national academy of sciences ' recommendations .
