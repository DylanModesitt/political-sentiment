mr. chairman , the energy policy before us is comprehensive and timely . 
it bolsters the economy while preserving the environment , recognizing that one need not be sacrificed for the other . 
in addressing both present and future concerns , this plan provides real improvements to our energy policy with the goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil . 
this bill looks inward by expanding our refinery capacities and tapping into our domestic resources in an environmentally safe way . 
this will help provide relief for rising gas prices and begin to safeguard us against the whims of opec . 
beyond traditional energy , this plan promotes the development of renewable fuels . 
by approving this bill , we will do much for the development and expansion of alternative fuels . 
for example , the increased use of ethanol will not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil but will also benefit our economy and environment . 
farmers in kansas and across the country stand ready to help with this effort . 
we have gone without a national energy plan for far too long . 
we must act now and finally pass this forward-looking energy plan into law .
