madam chairman , i thank the gentleman for his amendment and thank him for his active response corps . 
and i would just like to close by saying that douglas feith , who is the under secretary for defense and policy , recently stated that there is a strong argument that the united states should be intensifying its efforts to build partnership capacity with other countries to give them the capability to fight terrorism at home , not just law enforcement , not just military but also civilian administration and education .
