madam speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , let me remind my colleagues what this small , innocuous bill does . 
it says to the secretary of labor and to osha that the arbitrary , 15-day deadline that is in the statute for complying with an osha citation or to respond to osha can , in fact , be waived under special circumstances , if osha believes that the employer missed it by accident or had other extenuating circumstances , they have the option of extending the 15-day deadline . 
that is all this bill does . 
now , some of my colleagues on the other side have suggested , well , no , they already have this authority . 
but the fact is , they do not . 
the ability of the commission to waive a deadline on a case-by-case basis when circumstances warrant it have been drawn into increased legal uncertainty by the recent decision of the u.s. circuit court of appeals for the second circuit in chao v. lefrois builder , incorporated , and indeed , as recently as 2003 , osha has argued that oshrc does not have the authority to apply this rule . 
so we think that voluntary cooperation between osha and the employer community will , in fact , lead to a safer workplace . 
and as the chart showed that i displayed earlier , workplace injuries and fatalities have continued to decrease in each year of the bush administration . 
let us make this commonsense change to help employers and their workers achieve a safer workplace .
