mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
let me say i am disappointed that the majority does not agree that we ought to really look at renewable fuels . 
this , to me , is part of the reason why the bill is so problematic . 
i do not believe there is a commitment on the majority side to look at renewable fuels . 
this does not strike anything . 
this does not add any more money . 
this just allows companies to apply for these grants from the secretary of energy . 
if the secretary of energy feels it is not worthy or it is one company , they can reject it . 
this does not add anything . 
this just would show that we are serious in looking at other renewable fuels . 
why would we want to restrict the amount of the different kinds of renewable fuels that we can look at ? 
this is technology into the future . 
we should be expanding these things . 
here we are just saying , open it up and let other groups apply . 
they can be rejected if it is not meritorious . 
we believe p-series fuels are very important and can help us in the future to look at alternative sources of energy other than gasoline . 
i am deeply disappointed , and i think this again shows the problems with the underlying bill . 
the majority is not really serious in my opinion , with all due respect , in trying to find alternative ways that americans can get their energy from other than gasoline . 
that is why this bill is a big sock to the oil-producing companies and to the special interest industries , because whenever we want to expand it to help the american people , we are told , no , no , it is no good . 
again , this does not add any money . 
this just says let other people apply . 
if a secretary of energy deems these applications are not good , they can reject them . 
i can see no reason why there is opposition . 
i am very disappointed , and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
