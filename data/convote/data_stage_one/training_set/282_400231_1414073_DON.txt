mr. chairman , i have the greatest respect for the gentleman from indiana ( mr. pence ) xz4003150 . 
the problem with this provision , as with much of the bill , is the lack of judgment that our secretary of state could bring to bear as a new , tragic darfur-like situation erupts someplace . 
we do not question the need for improving the peacekeeping process , we are with you totally on that , but we would like to have our secretary of state have the opportunity of exercising her judgment in a rapidly changing and evolving situation .
