mr. speaker , i agree with the gentleman , it was never discussed in committee . 
that is precisely the point . 
the restrictive language being put forward , which would say no faith-based group could participate , has never been debated in this committee and we are not allowed to do an amendment on the floor . 
yes , it is part of the manager 's amendment along with a number of other things such as preference for the gulf . 
all we asked for was an ability to vote on some of these specific things . 
i agree , it was not brought up in committee . 
it was brought up in a private session between the republican study committee and the then-majority leader . 
that is not an appropriate forum to be the only place where we discuss things .
