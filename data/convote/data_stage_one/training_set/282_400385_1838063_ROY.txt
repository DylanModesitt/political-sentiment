mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from minnesota ( mr. kennedy ) xz4002141 , the gentlewoman from oregon ( ms. hooley ) xz4001860 , the gentleman from nebraska ( mr. osborne ) xz4003030 , and the others who have been working on this amendment and many others over the last few weeks on methamphetamines , a scourge that is sweeping our country , starting to hammer some of our major cities , and is going to be something that we have not seen for a long time in america unless we can get control of this . 
starting in oklahoma , many states , including my home state of indiana , have tried to regulate pseudoephedrine through drug stores and grocery stores by putting it behind the counter . 
but unless we control it internationally , it is irrelevant because what they will do is they will go to the internet . 
these large trafficking organizations will bring it in . 
we have to get at it at the manufacturing level and the wholesale level . 
laws like these at the state level may work for a year , but they are not a long-term solution . 
we have to address it from an international perspective . 
in mexico alone , the mexican imports of pseudoephedrine , and these are coming from just a few countries in the world , with india having most of the plants , china , and one in europe , they are estimating imports have risen from 100 tons to 224 tons and their demand is 70 tons . 
that means we have 150 new tons of pseudoephedrine pouring across the border from mexico . 
we must get control of this from a national and international perspective .
