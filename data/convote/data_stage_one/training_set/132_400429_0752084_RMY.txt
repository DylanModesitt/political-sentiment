madam chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 6 , balanced legislation designed to reduce our dependence on imported energy , a balanced approach that has earned bipartisan support in the house committee on ways and means , emphasizes conservation , alternative sources of energy , as well as finding more domestic sources of energy . 
i take my brief amount of time to focus on what i consider to be the most consumer-oriented provision of this legislation , legislation that rewards conservation , conservation at home . 
twenty percent of all the energy we consume in america , one-fifth of our energy consumed , is consumed at home . 
in fact , the average american spends about $ 1 , 500 a year in heating and cooling their home . 
just think if they could save 10 , 20 , 30 percent . 
it means not only energy conservation to save energy but it would help their pocketbooks as well . 
this legislation today contains provisions out of h.r. 1212 , legislation that provides up to a $ 2 , 000 tax credit that homeowners can use in their existing home to make it more energy efficient , put in better windows , better doors , better insulation , do a better job of sealing the home . 
if they meet the federal standard by reducing their energy consumption by 30 percent , they can reduce their taxes with up to a $ 2 , 000 tax credit , 20 percent of the first $ 10 , 000 they invest . 
bottom line is we need to encourage energy conservation . 
what better place to start than right at home . 
i urge bipartisan support for this legislation .
