mr. chairman , unfortunately , in the uc agreement that we have before us , the wrong amendment is listed . 
it actually amends title i ; so , therefore , it should be out of order . 
it was supposed to be on the reading is fundamental program , which is much more appropriate to this title , and i have asked the chairman if he would engage in a colloquy . 
my amendment , which could not be introduced because of the error , specified that $ 25 , 296 , 000 in the school improvements program be dedicated specifically to the reading is fundamental program . 
i seek assurances from the chairman that this program will receive adequate funding when the final numbers are decided in the conference with the senate . 
it is very well documented , mr. chairman , that a great number of children and adults struggle with reading . 
thirty-seven percent of american fourth graders read below the basic level on the national assessment of education progress reading test . 
additionally , 55 percent of all fourth graders eligible for free or reduced lunch score below what is called the `` basic. '' this sad state of affairs is perpetuated as 40 million adults in the u.s. can not even read a simple child 's story . 
the reading is fundamental program is a time-tested program that has combated illiteracy since 1966 . 
reading is fundamental is a family literacy organization that helps children discover the joy of reading . 
it provides new books to children in many communities ; and last year alone , reading is fundamental provided 17 million new , free books to close to 5 million kids across the country . 
it engages children and their parents to utilize all aspects of a child 's environment : the school , the home , the community , all to reinforce literacy . 
i would like to learn more from the chairman about his views on this program and if he will assist in making sure that funding is appropriated .
