mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
let me correct an error that was made . 
the very fact is that the amendment would only restrict funds for the provision that gives wal-mart the 15 days ' advance notice before the department investigates any wage-and-hour law complaints . 
it does not abrogate the entire settlement . 
that is what wal-mart would like to have everyone believe . 
it is just the 15-day notice . 
the fact is that this is not a typical agreement . 
none of the agreements that the department of labor made with genesis health ventures , footlocker , and sears provided a blanket promise of advance notice nationwide to all their stores . 
this one does . 
it is a sweetheart deal with wal-mart . 
nor did they provide for a 10-day window for the company to come into compliance in the event of child labor violations . 
these companies were expected to fix the problem immediately or to face serious penalties . 
this is hardly standard procedure . 
that is why the labor department 's own inspector general has been investigating how this settlement was negotiated . 
we are talking about the safety of our children . 
that is why the amendment is necessary , and that is why i ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment .
