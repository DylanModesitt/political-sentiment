mr. chairman , i thank the chairman for yielding me this time . 
i rise in opposition to this amendment because it seeks to overturn two court decisions and what judge wedoff said was `` the least of the bad '' alternative `` choices here has got to be the one that keeps the airline functioning , that keeps employees being paid. '' we have to look out for the interests of all people , especially the 62 , 000 employees of united airlines right now , just crawling out of bankruptcy , on whom the future of the entire western chicagoland region , o'hare airport , and many of the related businesses depend . 
if we push united into bankruptcy , and especially if we push her further into liquidation , we will not only have an employee pension problem , but we will have a massive unemployment problem . 
we will also jeopardize the crown jewel of the economic development i think we should make sure that this process moves forward , we should make sure that this airline continues to function , and we should make sure that the 62 , 000 current employees of united are allowed to find their way back into profitability so they can put food on their table , especially in my district and other illinois districts .
