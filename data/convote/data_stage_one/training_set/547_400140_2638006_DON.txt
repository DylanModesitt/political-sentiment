mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds to welcome the conversion of the gentleman from texas to an increased section 8 voucher program . 
we on our side have several times offered amendments to do that in the appropriations bill . 
i did not remember him as a supporter . 
but conversion is a great thing , and i celebrate it , and i look forward to the gentleman from texas voting with us the next time we move to increase the section 8 voucher program . 
but it does not solve all of the problems . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. lee ) xz4002370 , someone who has been very hardworking , both on voter registration and on housing .
