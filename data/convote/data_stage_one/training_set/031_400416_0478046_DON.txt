mr. chairman , i really appreciate the gentleman 's support of this amendment . 
i would say that it does not surprise me that the department of state would raise a concern because they are the worst offenders when it comes to fulfilling the statutory goals set by congress regarding contracting practices on behalf of small businesses in our nation . 
i would love to see that the gentleman work with me on behalf of small businesses and make sure that in this $ 81 billion there is small business participation . 
they can do the work and they can do it more effectively than many of the large corporations that are mismanaging and misappropriating much of the money that has been spent so far .
