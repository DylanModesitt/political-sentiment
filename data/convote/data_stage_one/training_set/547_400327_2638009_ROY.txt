mr. chairman , i would like to congratulate the chairman and mr. baker xz4000120 and mr. frank xz4001400 and mr. ney xz4002930 and the many members who have worked so hard on this issue for years now . 
this is a strong bill that creates a world-class regulator for fannie mae , freddie mac and the federal home loan bank at a time when one is much needed . 
i rise today , mr. chairman , because i am concerned about specific provisions in the manager 's amendment which could have unintended consequences on members of our senior population and the ability of nonprofits to work together to serve low-income communities . 
specifically , mr. chairman , i would like to receive some assurance from you that you will work with me on these issues as we move toward a final bill in conference . 
and first i would like to work to clarify language in the amendment so it does not disqualify nonprofits from participating in the affordable housing fund if they transport their own senior housing residents to the polls . 
that is with the understanding that many of these seniors have no other option to get to the polls but for their own nursing home 's transportation facilities .
