mr. chairman , i rise in strongest opposition to the miller amendment . 
five unions have been involved in the negotiation process here to ensure that over 60 , 000 people are able to keep their jobs and a very , very important company continues to remain alive . 
there is one union that has chosen not to be supportive of this . 
the fact that one union is not supportive of this agreement working between united airlines and the pension benefit guaranty corporation has now created a scenario where we want to take the entire package down , and i believe that it would undermine a very important part of the commerce of the united states of america . 
we all know how important the airline is to the very vibrant economy that we have today . 
so i urge my colleagues to oppose the miller amendment and let us proceed to ensure that we do not see 62 , 000 people lose their jobs .
