mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i will not even take all that time . 
i simply want to repeat the arguments against this amendment . 
there are no funds in this bill that go to saudi arabia . 
there is a prohibition in the fiscal year 2005 foreign operations bill that prohibits any funds from going to saudi arabia , and that prohibition applies to this bill . 
this amendment is totally unnecessary . 
this amendment has absolutely no bearing . 
it is simply repeating what is already in the existing law that applies to this bill . 
to add another prohibition here now is simply to add insult to injury . 
it is gratuitous . 
it has absolutely no reason to be in this bill , and i would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
