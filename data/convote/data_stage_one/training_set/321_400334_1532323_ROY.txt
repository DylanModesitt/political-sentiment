mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
obviously this is a committee on ways and means and committee on energy and commerce issue . 
but let me point out that this amendment will prevent seniors from getting essential coverage information , and that is important . 
they want to know what their coverage is . 
they want to know what the coverage will be under the new medical services . 
this enrollment starts in less than 5 months , and i think this would be a poor time to take away the ability to give seniors information about the new drug benefit . 
we have a lot of , a considerable amount of money in this bill to provide the necessary employees to disseminate information , take phone calls from seniors who want to find out about the medicare modernization act , and to deprive the cms of the ability to meet this need would be a serious problem for seniors . 
let us give them every chance to call and to find out about the new medicare modernization act . 
let us not in any way limit the availability of information and the access that seniors should have to information about this possible benefit . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
