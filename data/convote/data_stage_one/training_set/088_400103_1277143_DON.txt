mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i rise to speak on the hinchey amendment to require that the fda stop waiving conflict of interest revelations by their advisors and to start to make an affirmative search for scientists who can give unconflicted advice to this critically important agency . 
unfortunately , there is abundant evidence that scientists are being invited onto and accepted onto these committees , even when they tell the fda that they have a conflict . 
they are permitted to serve , regardless of conflict . 
this must stop . 
other agencies , such as the nih , have regularly found unconflicted , fully qualified professional advisors so that the agency can receive the best , unbiased advice possible . 
i am mindful that there may be scientists whose expertise deserves to be presented to an advisory committee , and nothing in this amendment , as i understand it , precludes these individuals from being asked to testify before a committee . 
when enacted , this amendment will also start to contribute to and rebuild the credibility of the actions of fda . 
we can not have even the aura of influence by the pharmaceutical industry or other regulated industries when it comes to the fda . 
surely , in a country that is renowned for its scientific and medical expertise , i think we have 125 medical schools in the united states , that it is possible to find scientists without conflicts of interest to advise the fda and to protect the public health . 
i urge support for the hinchey amendment .
