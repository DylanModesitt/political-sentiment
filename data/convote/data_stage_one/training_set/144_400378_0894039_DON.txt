mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i will be asking members to vote `` no '' on the previous question . 
if the previous question is defeated , i will offer an amendment to the rule to instruct the enrolling clerk to make an important addition to the conference report . 
this addition will establish a select committee to investigate the awarding and carrying out of war-related contracts in afghanistan and iraq . 
nearly $ 9 billion of money spent on the iraq reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management , according to the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction . 
ensuring vigilant oversight of taxpayer dollars should not be a partisan issue . 
i want to stress that a `` no '' vote on the previous question will not stop consideration of the emergency supplemental report . 
a `` no '' vote will simply allow the house to create a much-needed select committee to investigate government contracts in iraq and afghanistan . 
a `` yes '' vote on the previous question will prevent the house from establishing this important select committee . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately before the vote on the previous question .
