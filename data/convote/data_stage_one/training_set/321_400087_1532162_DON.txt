mr. chairman , i thank my friend for yielding me this time , and i thank both the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 for his comments and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. linda t. snchez ) . 
i think that this amendment is wrongheaded . 
i do not believe it will have the effect that the sponsor wants to have , and that is that all undocumented illegal aliens will just ship up and move back home . 
it plays well on some radio and television stations , but in reality it will have no effect . 
in the state of new york , our constitution requires that every child be afforded an education , whether that child is a legal citizen and resident or an undocumented alien or their parents are . 
tb does not have the ability to discern as to whether someone is documented or undocumented . 
when that child 's mother or father contracts that disease , they give it to their child and their child goes to school . 
our children are the ones who are exposed to those diseases . 
our children then become the victims of what this amendment would do if it were to pass . 
this amendment will not have that effect . 
it will just be a chilling effect on all people who question their status in this country , and they will then not go and get the care that they need to protect the rest of our children .
