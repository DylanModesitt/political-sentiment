mr. chairman , it is with some reluctance i rise now in opposition to h.r. 1461 , the federal housing finance reform act . 
in its amended form , the legislation no longer puts the best interest of our nation at heart , but instead holds a precious resource hostage for the sake of partisan politics . 
the provision restricting non-profit organizations , and their affiliates , from using their own funds to engage in non-partisan voter registration or get-out-the-vote activities if they want to apply for the much-needed affordable housing funds is entirely inappropriate . 
election activities promoting good citizenship conducted by unbiased , non-profit organizations should be encouraged , not restricted . 
to add insult to injury , the new provision imposes a new burden of requiring these groups to list housing assistance as their `` primary purpose '' if they want to apply for funds . 
the effect of this constraint will be to reduce the diversity of assistance that will be available . 
with such a growing need for affordable housing , and for competent groups capable of connecting people with the already scarce resources , i can not imagine why my colleagues would want to handicap these organizations from providing assistance to our nation 's most vulnerable populations . 
it is for these reasons i can not support this otherwise sound and reasonable measure to improve the regulation of our nation 's largest source of mortgages . 
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on h.r. 1461 .
