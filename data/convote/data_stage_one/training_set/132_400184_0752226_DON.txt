mr. chairman , i yield myself 2 minutes , and i thank my colleague for yielding her time to me . 
mr. chairman , to begin to address the second order amendment , which , as i say , may be technically and in parliamentary terms called a perfecting amendment , but in fact it would gut the amendment , it does not get at the heart of the problem , which is that the tests are wrong . 
the tests are unrealistic . 
the tests give results that bear no relationship to reality . 
why should taxpayers pay for a test , a government-mandated test , or auto purchasers pay for a test that gives inaccurate information ? 
we need to fix the epa test . 
it can be fixed without giving the folks in the state of michigan or other automobile manufacturing areas heartburn . 
it does not change the fleet average calculation . 
it only addresses the issue of consumer information , so that the purchaser will have accurate information . 
if you use this scale factor , or fudge factor , it will paper over the underlying problem . 
it will distort the fuel efficiency difference between different types of vehicles . 
in fact , my colleague earlier talked about how some hybrid vehicles behave differently under different situations . 
the tests themselves need to be changed , not an after-the-fact fudge factor , so that when you go into the showroom to purchase a car and you see the number in the window for city mileage and highway mileage , you will have a reasonable expectation that that car , when used on actual american streets and actual american highways , will give mileage comparable to what is posted there . 
the ad says your actual mileage may vary . 
the way it is today , with the tests that we have , your actual mileage may bear no relationship whatsoever to what is printed in the window . 
that is what we are trying to correct with the johnson-holt amendment . 
the rogers second order amendment completely changes the nature of what we are trying to do .
