well , again , it illustrates just how valuable the tax relief has been to our economy . 
we have spoken this evening at length about over 4 million new jobs . 
four million new jobs in the future that have been created . 
four million new paychecks . 
that is what compassion is all about . 
compassion is not measured by the number of welfare checks that are printed in washington . 
it is measured by the number of paychecks that are printed all over the united states of america . 
our gdp growth , 2 1/2 years straight where each and every quarter of economic growth has been over 3 percent . 
we have consumer spending that is advancing , advanced 4.2 percent during the third quarter . 
retail sales are up . 
real disposable income for our working families is up since we passed the tax relief package in our economic growth legislation . 
and manufacturing , which has faced many , many challenges in recent years , manufacturing production is continuing to expand . 
we have increases in productivity , and the list goes on and on and on . 
and all of this is threatened if we permit the democrats to offer their christmas gift to the american people , a huge tax increase ; and that is why it is so vital , so vital tomorrow that we do not allow that to happen .
