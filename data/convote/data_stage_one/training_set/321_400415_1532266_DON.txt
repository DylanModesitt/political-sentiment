mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i thank my colleague , the chairman of the committee education and the workforce , for those remarks ; but the action the congress took last year was too limited . 
first of all , it only lasted a year so we could come back this year to fix the problem ; but the other part of the problem was it left a big part of the loophole still in place , what is called `` recycling , '' so that the lenders can continue to receive this windfall of 9.5 percent guarantee on those loans . 
this amendment is prospective only . 
it does not look back ; it only looks to the future . 
nobody who has been promised certain returns on their loans will lose the promises they have been made . 
but what it prevents from happening is future recycling , future abuse in this program . 
so i urge adoption of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
