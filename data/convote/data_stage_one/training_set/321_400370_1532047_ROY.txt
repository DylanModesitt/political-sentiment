mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
mr. chairman , however well intended this amendment may be , it goes to the heart of what is very important in this country , and that is getting our young people to want to participate and be part of our society , and it employs a lot of young people from our urban areas . 
but , more important than that , is they work at minimum wage , but then they get a stipend to help pay for their education . 
why do we give away college grants , when young people are willing to work to get them ? 
for me , this is so central to what we believe as republicans : do not give them a grant , have them earn it . 
they earn these grants , they do incredible service throughout the country , and it replaces having young people do a job just to do a job . 
they do meaningful , meaningful work .
