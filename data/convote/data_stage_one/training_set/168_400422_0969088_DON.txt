mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
and i am surprised that my friend would propose that we increase the amount of money that taxpayers are paying for incarceration to now expand it to illegal aliens who commit crimes , leave the country and come back in . 
where are we going to get all of this money ? 
we have one of the highest incarceration rates of any nation in the entire world . 
and we are spending a disproportionate amount of money on incarceration . 
i submit to my colleagues that i think deportation is the answer , but have they thought about the fact that they should place the responsibility on keeping these criminals out of the country on the heads of the leaders of those countries ? 
we go right along with the leaders of these countries on trade agreements , on foreign assistance , with all kinds of assistance to these governments . 
i would submit to my colleagues that if they submit the name of everybody that they deport and they send them back and they say to the leaders of these countries , if these people come back , we are going to penalize you in one of several ways that we cooperate with you ; again , we have so many ways that we provide assistance to other countries , and we have got to make them responsible for keeping their criminals at home . 
so i do not like the idea that we have a problem and that we are deporting criminals , and they are coming back , and we are going to make the american people pay for it . 
make those other governments pay for it . 
do not end up in press conferences with this administration , the head of our government 's members of congress , working out all kinds of arrangements with these governments to help them in so many ways , whether it is trade , foreign assistance or 909 other ways that we help them . 
make them keep their criminals at home . 
penalize them if they do not . 
do not charge the american taxpayer .
