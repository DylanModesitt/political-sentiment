mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i thank the leader . 
given the time that is allocated to this bill , i presume , as the leader has apparently indicated , that it is the expectation of the committee on rules to have a full amendatory process . 
my expectation is you are not going to have a fully open rule but that you would have some modified open rule . 
am i correct on that ? 
i yield to the gentleman from texas .
