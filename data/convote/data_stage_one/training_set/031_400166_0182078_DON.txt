mr. chairman , many on this side of the aisle also support strong border protection . 
i certainly do , and i support the fence . 
this is not an argument , however , about whether to build a fence . 
it is about what process should be used , and this process is dead wrong . 
rather than reaching out to the governor of california , a leader in the party on the other side of the aisle , to reach compromise on this issue , the author of this bill has crafted language that will usurp all of governor schwarzenneger 's power regarding the border fence . 
to take the radical steps of eliminating all state and local powers , let alone federal , and rolling back all judicial review is the height of irresponsible legislating . 
mr. chairman , this bill sets the dangerous precedent of policing a single federal official , elected by no one , above all laws , and shields him from accountability , and the reach is beyond the san diego border . 
according to the language in this legislation , it is all areas along and in the vicinity of our international borders with both mexico and canada . 
this is the wrong way to do it . 
we need to do the right thing . 
mr. chairman , i support this amendment .
