reclaiming my time , i thank the gentleman . 
lastly , we just had a vote on the privileged resolution that was offered by the democratic leader , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 . 
that resolution , as you know , sought to try to move the ethics process forward so the ethics committee could do its work . 
hopefully , all of us believe that it is very important that the ethics committee be able to undertake its work . 
i would hope that the majority would take steps to perhaps discuss in a bipartisan way the implementation of the existing rules which we believe , as you know , require a majority vote for the hiring of a staff director . 
that is the way it has always been . 
from our perspective , that is the way it was intended to be . 
so it would be a bipartisan or , better yet , nonpartisan handling of the responsibility of the ethics committee . 
i would hope that in the near term , next week and the days thereafter , that we would work together to try to get this moving forward . 
because i think it is important to both sides of the aisle , it is important to the integrity of the house , and i think it is important to the american people .
