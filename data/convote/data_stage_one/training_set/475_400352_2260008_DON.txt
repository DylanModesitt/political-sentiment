this thing is a paper tiger . 
it is going to be a song and dance . 
so let us get ready . 
get out the music and the popcorn because this is going to be nothing but a dog and pony show . 
i do not think anything is going to happen here , and it is going to be consistent with a lot of the other pieces of legislation that either came through this body or did not get reviewed . 
so i just want to say to my colleague from florida how disappointed i am , how disappointed the democrats are , and i encourage the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 , our minority leader , to continue her stance and not appoint anybody to this committee . 
this is a toothless tiger . 
it is a washing machine to clean up this mess politically . 
i hope that our leader stands her ground and our leadership and our party stand their ground and just say that this is a joke and to appoint people to this committee would literally be contributing to the problem and lending our credibility to this issue , which i think is a joke .
