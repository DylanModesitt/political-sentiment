mr. speaker , after the vote on the previous question , i will call for a yes vote on the motion to commit . 
my motion to commit will prohibit sitting members of congress from negotiating for future employment with any person who has a direct interest in the legislation referred to any committee on which that member serves . 
it also includes a rules change that would require a two-thirds vote in the house to waive the requirement in our standing rules that members must have 3 days to read the committee reports . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert a statement as part of that immediately prior to the vote on the motion to commit .
