mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i always enjoy listening to the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules , the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 . 
he mentions that a handful of democratic amendments were made in order , and i guess we all should be grateful on this side of the aisle because usually we get shut out totally . 
but the fact of the matter is 16 democratic amendments were not made in order . 
sixteen amendments have been shut out from this debate . 
if this issue was so important , and it is important , then why can we not take the time to debate all the various ideas ? 
as i said , according to the schedule , we may be out of here at 4 o'clock today . 
i am willing to stay until 5 , or even until 6 or even until 7 to give these other people an opportunity to have their concerns voiced on this floor . 
we all represent communities , unfortunately , that have been touched by gang violence . 
all of us have dealt with community leaders , with our local police , in trying to figure out how best to deal with this violence . 
we all have good ideas . 
i think , especially on an issue like this , as many people who have these ideas should be able to bring them to the floor and to be able to debate them . 
but , unfortunately , 16 amendments have been totally blocked from consideration on this bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 .
