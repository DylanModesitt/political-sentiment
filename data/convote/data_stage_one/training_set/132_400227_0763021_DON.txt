well , the gentlewoman has made it possible for me to help and offer this amendment . 
we can grow our way out of our energy crisis ; and farmers growing biomass feedstocks that can be processed locally to supply , in our case , nearby cities such as cleveland and toledo can help us do that . 
they will benefit with new and more stable markets ; our fuel supply is home grown , thus reducing our dependence on foreign oil ; fuel prices are reduced ; and the air we breathe is cleaner . 
i yield to the gentlewoman .
