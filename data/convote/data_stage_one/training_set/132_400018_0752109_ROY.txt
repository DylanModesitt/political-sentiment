madam chairman , i do not think it is a surprise that i rise in strong support of the barton manager 's amendment , since i am the barton who authored the amendment . 
but i just want to tell my good friend from massachusetts , whom i just listened to extremely closely as he told his tale of woe about his amendment being accepted in committee and not accepted in the manager 's amendment , we found out , as we went to implement it , that there were some things we did not understand about his amendment . 
now , i am sure the gentleman explained it clearly and concisely , and i was probably listening to one of my staffers and probably just did not hear his explanation , but it was actually retroactive in application . 
madam chairman , had we accepted it and put it in the manager 's amendment , there would have been an immediate outcry to implement some standards that were not yet implementable because it would have been retroactive . 
that is the primary reason it is not in the manager 's amendment . 
as we go to conference , we will continue to work with the distinguished gentleman , and we probably can find some way to get some part of it in in the conference . 
but that is the primary reason that particular amendment is not in the manager 's amendment .
