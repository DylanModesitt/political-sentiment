mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
there are dozens of these settlements made every month . 
if we get into the role of trying to second-guess and to pass judgment on them , there is no end to it . 
i think what we know of the merits of this is something that the department of labor worked out with wal-mart . 
this is not an uncommon thing to give 15-day notice . 
in fact , it is almost a standard procedure . 
i say to my colleagues , we do not belong in involving ourselves , or this body , in trying to second-guess the judgment that has been made by the department of labor . 
i am sure they acted in good faith to protect the rights of children , to protect the rights of people that work at not only wal-mart but other similar types of employment . 
therefore , i would urge my colleagues to reject this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
