mr. chairman , today i offer an amendment to provide guidelines and incentives for states to civilly confine violent sexual predators . 
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and his staff for this support in working with my office on this provision . 
i would also like to thank the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 for his support as well . 
most criminals deemed as sexually violent have broken state , as opposed to federal , laws . 
this amendment would incentivize states to implement civil confinement programs . 
this is not a new or radical idea . 
as of 2002 , 16 states and the district of columbia have implemented some form of a civil confinement law . 
under this amendment , civil confinement would encompass those who admit their illness , as well as those who are deemed too dangerous to return to society without proper treatment and rehabilitation . 
texas prisoner larry don mcquay is an example of the kind of person who would merit civil confinement . 
he is a convicted child molester who describes himself alternatively as scum of the earth and a monster . 
he is currently serving a 20-year sentence for molesting three children .
