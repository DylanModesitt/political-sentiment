mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentlewoman from connecticut for offering this amendment . 
this is an outrageous practice that the government entered into in secret with wal-mart so that those employees who were concerned and want to file a labor grievance or a child labor protection law grievance with wal-mart who thought they were talking to the department of labor now find that they are talking directly to the wal-mart corporation . 
so where do they get the protection in filing these complaints ? 
you say , well , they do n't need it because wal-mart is a good employer and wal-mart is going to take care of them . 
wal-mart is a repeat serial offender and has been found guilty of violating wage-and-hour laws , immigration laws , child labor laws , discrimination laws , pay-equity laws and worker-safety laws . 
and this is the corporation that you give 15 days ' notice to , that you give this kind of special privilege to ? 
as the gentlewoman from connecticut pointed out , the violations of child labor are ongoing . 
all wal-mart does is get a heads-up and finds out who is complaining against them who is employed by them . 
how are these employees supposed to register their complaints with this corporation under this agreement ? 
it is an outrageous violation of these workers ' rights .
