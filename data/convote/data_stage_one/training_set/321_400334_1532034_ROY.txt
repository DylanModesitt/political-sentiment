mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
this , like many programs , is a great idea , a great help , with over 100 grants last year , but we do have a really tight budget . 
i know when we get to conference with the other body , that this probably will be one that has support , but it all depends on what is available in funding . 
i am sympathetic to it , but i can not guarantee anything . 
i think we would have to consider it . 
it has a trade-off , that is the problem at this juncture in your amendment , and that is it would cause the layoff of many employees .
