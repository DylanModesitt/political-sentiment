madam chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
madam chairman , i just want to briefly respond to the comments of my dear friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 , on the u.n . 
amendment . 
if you are serious about reforming the u.n. , and we all say that we are , then you have to have some leverage over them . 
more resolutions , we have endured a blizzard of resolutions and rhetoric about reform , but nothing ever happens . 
it just gets worse and worse . 
look at oil-for-food . 
but the way to get reform is to threaten them with cutting off the money pipeline . 
it has worked in the past ; it will work again . 
now , this does not mean that it is going to happen . 
this bill , if it goes anywhere , has to go through the other body , then through a conference . 
you go into those things with as much strength as you can , and it seems to me that we ought to do that with u.n . 
reform . 
but if we do not cut off the money if they fail to get certifications on 46 points that we all agree are essentially reform , we do not dispute , the democrats and republicans , the need for reform nor the items of reform . 
the dispute is how to implement . 
the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 suggests to leave it up to the secretary of state to have a waiver or not . 
my suggestion is , legislate the withholding if they do not live up to reform . 
what is more likely to get reform ? 
in any event , i hope that we will support the u.n . 
reform bill that puts some teeth into the implementation . 
madam chairman , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 .
