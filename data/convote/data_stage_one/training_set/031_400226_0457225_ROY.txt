mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . 
the gentlewoman has raised some very important points , and i know she has done a great deal of work in this area as it relates to charles taylor and west africa . 
there is no question it is a very troubled area , and charles taylor has certainly contributed to the instability in the region . 
there are no funds in the legislation that deal with nigeria , and there are a lot of circumstances around this issue that i think are difficult in the sense that the united states has played a role in all of this as to where he is at the moment . 
we do want this person brought to justice , and i know that is the intention of the united states . 
i would hope , however , that the gentlewoman would withdraw this amendment because i believe that would be in the best interest of united states foreign policy . 
we will certainly work with the gentlewoman and her staff to try to resolve the situation , and work with the state department and the gentlewoman to get a satisfactory explanation of what is being done .
