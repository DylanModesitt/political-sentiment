madam speaker , we will have an opportunity to debate the substance of this bill , i guess not only during the rule but afterwards , but i am still kind of baffled as to why this bill has to be brought to the floor under a closed rule , why the ranking democrats on the committee of jurisdiction could not even be given the courtesy of being allowed to offer an alternative . 
this is unbelievable to me , that a bill of this importance would come to the floor and we are entirely shut out . 
and speaking of being shut out , the gentleman from indiana ( mr. visclosky ) xz4004170 had four amendments to be brought before the rules committee . 
he waited patiently and testified before the rules committee . 
four good amendments , and all four of those were dismissed routinely as well . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr. visclosky ) xz4004170 .
