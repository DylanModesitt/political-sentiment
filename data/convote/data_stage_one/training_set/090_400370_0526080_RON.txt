mr. speaker , my heart goes out to terri schiavo , her parents , and family , and , yes , even to her husband . 
my heart goes out to everyone who may have found themselves in a similar situation in the past or might find themselves in a similar situation in the future . 
i wanted to stay back in connecticut and avoid having to cast a vote because i do not want to play god , and either way i vote i feel i am . 
we all know this is a time for real thoughtfulness and wisdom and inspiration , and i believe that is what we are all trying to do . 
on both sides of the aisle we ask `` let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight , o lord , my strength and my redeemer. '' sanctity of life , sanctity of marriage , sanctity of an individual to decide for themselves what should happen to their own life , i find myself wondering why is there so much focus on this life when we ignore the countless lives throughout the world who die minute by minute , hour by hour , day by day from hunger and disease that this congress could address and this congress could prevent ? 
why only terri when there are others like her in our country ? 
the only way this bill has any legitimacy is if it applies to all cases , not just terri 's , and that is what concerns me . 
how deep is this congress going to reach ? 
how deep is this congress going to reach into the personal lives of each and every one of us ?
