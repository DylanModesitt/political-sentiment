mr. chairman , i want to commend my friend from new york for offering this amendment . 
our side is prepared to accept the gentleman 's amendment . 
the diplomatic immunity that the united nations is granted under international law is not designed to shield its employees from the due process of law when they commit crimes . 
secretary general kofi annan has stated on numerous occasions that he would never allow the u.n. 's diplomatic immunity to protect any employee from prosecution for a crime she or he may have committed . 
the lantos-shays substitute has a parallel amendment , and we are happy to accept the gentleman 's amendment .
