mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time to wrap up my comments by saying that we all know what corruption looks like , smells like , and acts like . 
we are seeing corruption at many different levels in the u.n. , and i would request that all members support this amendment , which would limit the unauthorized contact between the united nation employees and the nations which have been sanctioned . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
