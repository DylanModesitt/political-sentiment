mr. chairman , i would like to thank the gentleman from illinois for introducing this resolution . 
i will be voting today in favor of h. j. res. 65 because i believe the brac commission 's recommendations should be overturned . 
i commend the commission for their thorough and diligent work . 
they certainly had a very difficult job . 
however , i believe that now is not the time to implement a brac round , considering the number of operations our armed services are currently engaged in around the world . 
i have great concern about the pentagon 's ability to adequately assess our needs and assets while there are so many soldiers abroad and while the pentagon awaits the results of the quadrennial review . 
i am also concerned about the commission 's recommendation to place cannon air force base in enclave status . 
this decision places cannon in enclave status until 2009 , or until a new mission can be identified for the base . 
i do view this recommendation as a partial victory for new mexico since the department of defense initially slated cannon for closure , but i firmly believe that cannon should simply have been removed from the list altogether . 
cannon offers the air force and its pilots unrestricted airspace and training ranges just off its runways . 
this is a rarity in today 's air force , as more bases experience increasing encroachment . 
this unparalleled airspace is in the process of being expanded , making the base even more valuable . 
when approved , the new mexico training range initiative would make cannon 's airspace wider and taller and allow for training at supersonic air speed . 
i strongly believe we will be able to identify appropriate missions for cannon air force base to minimize the amount of time during which the base will remain in enclave status . 
nevertheless , cannon is too important to our national defense for it to be placed in enclave status . 
i urge passage of h. j. res. 65 .
