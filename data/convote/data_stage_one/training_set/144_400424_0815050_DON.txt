mr. speaker , i am really saddened today , and i am not sure whether i am more disappointed because of the mischaracterization of the amendments in the committee report or whether i am more saddened by the fact that the members of a committee on which i have served now for 13 years would be here on the floor defending the characterization that was put in the committee 's report . 
i would just hope that we can get the committee to file an amended report that clears this up and we can put this behind us and go on . 
this is saddening , and if we can not get that , i think it would be a really , really sad commentary on this institution and what our committee has sunk to in this congress .
