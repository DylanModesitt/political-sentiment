mr. chairman , the johnson amendment requires the epa to change the testing procedures that auto companies use to determine the fuel economy numbers that go on the dealer label . 
her amendment requires auto companies to do one test for labeling and a separate test for cafe . 
the language in this amendment costs the companies approximately twice as much as the simpler testing they are doing now . 
this goes to the heart of what we are doing to the auto industry now , unintentionally perhaps , and that is beating up on them ; and we should not do that . 
the rogers amendment deals with the need for improved dealer label accuracy , while only requiring one test . 
instead of requiring the epa to change testing procedures , the rogers amendment requires the epa to change the adjustment factors that the epa currently uses to make the fuel economy label accurate . 
this is the way to go . 
it achieves the goal we all want to have , accuracy , in a much more reasonable and a much less expensive way . 
it is not a fudge .
