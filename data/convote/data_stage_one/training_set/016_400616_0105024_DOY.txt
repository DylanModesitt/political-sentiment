mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i do not accept the suggestion that the academic community is un-american and not in support of our military . 
my friends in the academic community , and i have many in north carolina who are part of the academic community , they are good americans and they support our military completely . 
i sincerely believe that these individuals have a genuine difference of legal opinion that must be resolved by our supreme court , and that is why i am supporting this resolution . 
we need a determination by our supreme court of this matter . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
