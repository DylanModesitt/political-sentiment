mr. chairman , i am offering this amendment as part of the agreement that i referred to earlier with the chairman of the committee on agriculture . 
i am offering the amendment under the agreement that we would add $ 40 million back to the environmental quality incentives program account . 
that is what the amendment does , and it is paid for by increasing the limitations on the conservation security program , the wildlife habitat incentives program , and the farm and ranchlands protection program .
