mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
not too long ago , my wife came to me . 
she had , the night before , seen a program on television . 
she said , john , is it true that the u.n . 
peacekeepers are trading sex for peanut butter with 9- and 10-year-old kids ? 
she could not believe it . 
i looked at her , and i said , cathy , it 's true . 
that is happening . 
i talked to chairman smith and he subsequently held hearings . 
they came over and assured us that things were getting better . 
we were told that basically the implication was on the battlefield , these things happen , sexual abuse occurs . 
my response was , this is n't sexual abuse . 
that taking pictures of 9- and 10-year-old kids , exploiting them , was child abuse and a criminal matter . 
we heard that there would be zero tolerance . 
a week later , another television program and the guy said , we have heard there is going to be zero tolerance . 
he said , what does that mean ? 
he showed pictures of these guys sneaking out at night to a village , again to do their work and showed a picture of a guy riding around in a u.n . 
vehicle with a prostitute . 
i think we have worked , we have held our hearings , we have coerced . 
i think the time now is to demand accountability . 
again , i would ask all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
