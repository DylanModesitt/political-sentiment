mr. chairman , like so many times when i stand up here , i am very fond of the author of the amendment , but i do not like the amendment . 
the name of udall is almost a sacred name in the west . 
the salient part of this bill , i think of this entire bill , that the gentleman from texas ( chairman barton ) has brought to us and we have passed through committee and subcommittee , is that it covers waterfront , and that means that we need all energy sources . 
this is just another of the sources that we pool together . 
i think assuring reliable , economical , and environmentally sensitive domestic uranium mining industry is essential to be a part of this bill and to carry out and make the fullness of the bill . 
as the gentleman from texas ( chairman barton ) pointed out , section 631 of the bill reported by the house committee on energy and commerce , i do not know how many votes were against it , but the committee authorizes a modest research and development program ; it is $ 10 million a year over a 3-year period . 
i think they have allocated the money out according to the good it will do . 
this program would be cost-shared , and it is consistent with far larger programs for other electricity generation . 
it makes no sense to eliminate this important funding and forego opportunities for this . 
for all of these reasons , i oppose the udall amendment .
