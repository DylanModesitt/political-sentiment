mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute . 
mr. chairman , i would also say that i note in the letter in the final audit report that there is a sentence which says : additionally , two of the charter schools that we audited did not expend title i funds entirely in accordance with applicable law and regulations . 
i do not know what the facts are with respect to that sentence , but i would simply say that i would not , in any way , want the acceptance of this amendment to be an indication that the congress is carte blanche accepting the fact that funds ought to continue for those two schools , because it seems to me we have an obligation to make certain that , even if we are trying to deal with the temporary problem , we do not want an improper expenditure of taxpayers ' money . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
