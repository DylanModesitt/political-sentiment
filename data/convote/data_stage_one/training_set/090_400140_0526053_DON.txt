mr. speaker , i yield myself 45 seconds . 
the gentleman 's remarks again emphasize that this is a judicial and not a legislative case . 
he says there are aspects of this case that call for judicial review . 
that is why we have courts . 
yes , other people can get other federal review by general statutes . 
none of the other cases he mentioned are in federal courts because a particular bill was passed in a particular situation to send them there based on a review of those facts . 
the gentleman is entitled to his view of the facts as he said . 
there are aspects of this case that lead him to think that it should go back into court . 
that is what courts are for . 
he has just described the antithesis of a legislative decision , particularly since almost none of the members have either as much information as he does . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr. baird ) xz4000110 .
