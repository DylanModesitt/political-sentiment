mr. chairman , if the gentlewoman would yield further , no , i would not have objected to having hearings . 
it is relatively simple . 
i do not mean to suggest it needs panels of hearings , but i never object to having a hearing . 
mr. chairman , i believe the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 has the right to close ?
