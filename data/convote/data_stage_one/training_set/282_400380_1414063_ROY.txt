mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for offering this amendment . 
one of the difficulties we had when involved with the arrearage issue some years ago was the fact that for many americans , it was a shock to learn how much of the voluntary and in-kind contributions the united states did make , which were justified , but for which we got no credit . 
i think by getting all of the information on assessed , voluntary and in-kind contributions , i think americans will be amazed , as will international friends around the world in like manner will be amazed , how much the u.s. government does provide . 
so often in-kind contributions like airlift for military operations in no way gets on the ledger , so we do not have a thorough and a full accounting of the u.s. contribution and how the money is spent . 
i commend the gentleman for his amendment .
