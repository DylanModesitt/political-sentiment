mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from new york . 
it boggles my mind that the united states provides any funding to the saudi kingdom . 
with all of its oil and all of its wealth , it is nothing short of insanity . 
it is no secret , in spite of what the last speaker said , that the saudi regime is a leading exporter of terrorism worldwide ; it is a leading financier of terrorism worldwide . 
the thought that one cent of american money is being spent in saudi arabia is an insult to every american taxpayer . 
the saudis continue to declare to the world that they are a progressive-thinking nation and they are our partners in the global war on terrorism . 
that is what their pr firm says , anyway . 
nothing could be further from the truth . 
this is our partner in peace ? 
fifteen of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals . 
that did not happen by accident . 
this is the same saudi arabia that has the worst record for religious tolerance on the planet , the same saudi arabia that exudes racism and anti-semitic hatred . 
our partners in peace ? 
how shameful for the united states . 
the saudis claim that they are prosecuting terrorists . 
who are they kidding ? 
saudi efforts to prosecute terrorists are inept at best and more accurately nonexistent . 
if they are doing anything in lebanon , it is for themselves , not for the people of the united states of america . 
i ask everyone to support the weiner amendment .
