mr. speaker , as members of congress , we have a moral obligation to protect innocent life and not stand idly by while an activist judge seeks to use extreme measures to destroy the life of an innocent woman . 
by transferring this matter to a federal court we will ensure terri is given every possible protection by allowing a federal judge to see whether her constitutional rights have been violated . 
life is precious and i will always work to see that it is protected . 
with so much controversy surrounding terri 's final wishes and current physical condition , i believe it is imperative that a federal court take a fresh look at this case . 
i commend my colleagues from both the house and senate for working around the clock to determine a legislative solution to ensure that terri 's life and her constitutional rights are protected . 
thomas jefferson once wrote that , `` [ t ] he care of human life and happiness , and not their destruction , is the first and only legitimate object of good government . 
i think jefferson was right . 
i welcome this opportunity to join my colleagues in this effort to help defend and protect innocent human life .
