mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
i support the castle-markey amendment and would say to my fellow republicans , if this is the party that believes in local government and decisions being made on the local level and the state level as opposed to the federal level , you would be supporting this amendment . 
it seems absolutely clear as can be to me that if you do not give authority , some authority , and rights to states and local communities , you are going to have companies come in and bully their way because they will not have to be answerable . 
they will not have to work out problems with their states and local governments . 
they will just have the capability to advise , and advice means very little . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the castle-markey-shays-andrews amendment , striking the liquefied natural gas ( lng ) siting language contained in section 320 of h.r. 6 . 
there are risks as well as benefits associated with the siting and expansion of lng terminals in populated areas . 
it is essential states be able to evaluate their effect on sensitive coastal areas . 
in long island sound just off connecticut , there is a very real possibility that a facility will be sited with little to no state or local input . 
we propose an amendment to restore the role of state and local authority in citing decisions . 
states and localities should be able to maintain the ability to review and impact decisions that could pose serious environmental and health hazards to its coastal areas and its citizens . 
my party has always believed state and local governments know best what works in their communities . 
mr. chairman , while energy security is a national issue , it seems to me , local communities , who will live with our decisions far into the future , deserve a voice in the decision-making process .
