mr. chairman , i recognize the importance of having standardized drivers ' licenses and identification cards . 
this should be done on a bipartisan basis , however . 
the real id act was not bipartisan , and it was moved too quickly through the legislative process . 
it was passed without any committee hearings or markups .
