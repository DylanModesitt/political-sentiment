mr. speaker , i yield myself 20 seconds . 
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 earlier implied that i was being inconsistent because i said i was for habeas corpus . 
he quoted something . 
he has just cited the inadequacy of habeas corpus in this case . 
yes , i am for habeas corpus . 
this goes , as he just acknowledged , far beyond it . 
secondly , he acknowledged our objections to this individual private bill on one case by blaming the senate . 
in other words , he has acknowledged that this is an inappropriate bill and that is all we have said . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from missouri ( mr. cleaver ) xz4006390 .
