madam chairman , i yield myself 1 minute . 
whether this bill passes or not , murder , rape , robbery will be illegal . 
people will be prosecuted . 
they will get time in jail . 
in fact , as i indicated before , for 15- to 19-year-old african americans in this country , one out of eight are already in jail today . 
this bill , which will try more juveniles as adults , will not only increase the number in jail but will also increase the crime rate . 
mandatory minimums have been shown to be discriminatory and waste the taxpayers ' money . 
the death penalty is discriminatory and does not do anything about crime . 
this bill will give 10 years mandatory minimums to second-offense fist fights , and that is not the kind of sentence that is going to do anything about these violent kinds of crimes that my colleagues are talking about . 
ten years , mandatory minimum , second offense , fist fight . 
madam chairman , i yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .
