i thank the gentleman . 
there will be an amendment coming up , the cubin amendment , which will seek to restore a better balance to federal land acquisition as opposed to pilt funding . 
let me just point on this map again , people point to the red state/blue state issue . 
the red in this case indicates the percentage of federal land ownership , or the incidence of federal land ownership . 
as my colleagues can see , there is a lot of red out there . 
we do not need as much red . 
the more red you have , the more red ink that local governments have . 
we need to restore this imbalance .
