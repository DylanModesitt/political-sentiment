mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume to respond to the gentleman . 
i would point out that when the bush budget summit agreement came to the floor of this house in the fall of 1990 , after many arduous months of negotiation with the bush administration and the democratic leadership and the republican leadership in the house , only 88 republicans supported the passage of that bill , which had the president 's support behind it . 
in 1993 , when we passed the clinton budget act and began the unprecedented march towards lower and lower deficits , eventuating in a surplus of $ 236 billion in the year 2000 , not a single republican in either house voted for that deficit reduction effort . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr. gene green ) .
