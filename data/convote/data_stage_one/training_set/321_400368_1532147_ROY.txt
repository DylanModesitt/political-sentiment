mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time , and i rise in strong support of the amendment . 
i think the point that needs to be made here is what the gentleman from arizona ( mr. kolbe ) xz4002260 , my colleague , has already made , and that is , this was indeed a rather sudden ruling , and it does change what is happening . 
these schools have , in fact , been funded for years , and the only point that has not been made on this floor yet today , i do not believe , is that if the ruling is allowed to stand , funding will be cut off in less than 30 days . 
it will be cut off in about 12 days , on july 1. my colleagues can say what they will about the impact upon the school . 
i think we ought to focus upon the impact on students . 
in arizona , schools begin the school year as early as august 1. my wife who is a teacher will be going back to school on august 1. parents need to plan where their children are going to go to school this fall , and were this ruling to be allowed to stand , it would mean children would have less than a month to try to find a new school . 
to do that to low-income and special-needs children , to deprive those schools of the funding they need to provide that type of education , and to do it on that short of notice is inappropriate . 
this is a ruling that directly affects arizona today and about five other states immediately , but it holds the potential of affecting all 50 states . 
the ruling i think ought to be discussed on the merits , and i think the congress should do that , but we appreciate the opportunity to at least temporarily suspend its impact for the sake of the children in arizona who want to continue to be educated at these schools , many of which are in low-income areas , and these moneys , in particular , go to low-income needs . 
so i thank the gentleman for his position .
