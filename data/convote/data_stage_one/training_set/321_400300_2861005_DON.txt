mr. speaker , if one looks at the budget act , the purpose of the budget act was to force a congress to get away from runaway spending and runaway deficits by forcing the congress to confront trade-offs between spending and revenues . 
in fact , the congress is being prevented from doing that and the congress is being shielded from facing those explicit trade-offs unless amendments such as this are offered and debated fully in the house . 
we recognize that funding for these programs under the budget resolution is being cut back in order to make room in that same budget resolution for the tax cuts that have been provided and to make room for further tax cuts which the majority party is talking about offering this week . 
if we can not offer this kind of an amendment , then it would seem to me that the entire budget process has been intellectually corrupted and turned into a mere enforcement mechanism for majority party will rather than being used as a device to work out an explicit and forthright set of trade-offs . 
i would urge the chair to reject the point of order .
