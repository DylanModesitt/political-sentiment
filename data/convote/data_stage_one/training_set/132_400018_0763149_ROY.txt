mr. chairman , i just want to add my support for the amendment . 
i think it helps the bill . 
i would encourage my friend from washington , as he once again gets another amendment in the bill , to consider voting for final passage . 
he is going to have more stuff in the bill than i am . 
so at some point in time the weight of the evidence is that he should be supportive of the bill .
