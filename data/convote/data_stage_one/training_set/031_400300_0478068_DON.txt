mr. speaker , let me simply congratulate the gentlewoman from oregon ( ms. hooley ) xz4001860 for her motion . 
i would hope that every member supports it . 
i think that the contents of it are important . 
in fact , we need to go further . 
we have increased in this bill insurance benefits for servicemen and women who die up to $ 400 , 000 , but servicemen and women who come back from combat who are brain damaged , who have lost their sight , who have lost their arms , who have lost their legs , they come back to really very little assistance from uncle sam . 
in addition to what the gentlewoman is talking about , we also need to be looking at the huge hole that still exists in the earning power of those individuals , and we need to do a whole lot more than we are doing today . 
i think the hooley amendment is a great start , and i would urge every member of the house to vote for it .
