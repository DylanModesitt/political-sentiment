mr. chairman , i support this bill so that we can , and the public can , rely on the energy-conscious information that they are getting and that they know that is correct and accurate , and they can move forward with that . 
mr. chairman , members , are your constituents also asking you what you are doing about high gas prices ? 
we must answer that question in this bill . 
individuals can do something about their gasoline consumption when they select a car to buy . 
we need to help them . 
people expect that , when they look at the window sticker , the miles per gallon figures that the epa supplies are what they will get when they purchase the car . 
they are not . 
when one of my staff members complained to the car dealer that the gas mileage figures were way off for city driving for the car she had selected for its fuel efficiency , the dealer said , `` oh , that does n't apply to driving in dc. '' i support this amendment because it would require the epa to correct the long-standing inaccuracies in its testing procedures . 
our constituents must be able to rely on these facts to be the energy-conscious consumers they want to be .
