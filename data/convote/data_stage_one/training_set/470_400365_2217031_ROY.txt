mr. chairman , i rise to offer this amendment to respond to the law enforcement problems being faced by louisiana , mississippi , alabama , texas , and other states as a result of the devastation from hurricane katrina . 
it is estimated that at least 15 , 000 sex offenders have been relocated from the affected area as a part of disaster relief efforts . 
criminal records and sex offender information are , in many cases , not available to law enforcement or the community to track these offenders as they move to new areas . 
but this is just the tip of the iceberg . 
it has been reported by the texas department of justice , for example , that the state is experiencing significant increases in violent crime . 
there are 1 , 350 sex offenders unaccounted for in houston alone after being evacuated from louisiana . 
the parole department in louisiana has no idea where these people are and can provide no identifying information , fingerprints or photos . 
reports also indicate that crimes against children in texas shelters are rising . 
these states are in desperate need of federal assistance . 
my amendment does just that by directing the justice department to provide technical assistance to help law enforcement in these areas and to identify sex offenders who have been relocated . 
it is critical we protect our children while disaster relief is being provided , and i urge support of the amendment .
