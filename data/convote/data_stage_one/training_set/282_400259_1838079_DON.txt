mr. chairman , i stand to offer my strong support for the hooley-souder-baird amendment . 
the meth crisis is taken very seriously in minnesota , and i am proud of the work our local law enforcement officials are doing . 
they know very well how difficult this problem is , both the local production of methamphetamine and the explosion in trafficking . 
while i support efforts to attack local labs and local meth production , we all know it is not enough . 
the meth epidemic , as i said , is poisoning and polluting minnesota , where as much as 80 percent of the methamphetamine is produced in superlabs trafficked by mexican narcoterrorist gangs . 
the bush administration and congress must work with mexico and apply real pressure to the mexican government to attack meth production and the trafficking on their side of the border . 
this amendment is a good start . 
while states like minnesota continue to limit and ban pseudoephedrine , these superlabs operating outside of our boarders are continuing to put the chemicals that are destroying families on our streets . 
banning pseudoephedrine will not stop the problem , but banning meth in mexico could .
