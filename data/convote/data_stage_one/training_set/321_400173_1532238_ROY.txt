mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
mr. chairman , quoting the words of my friend , the gentleman from rhode island ( mr. kennedy ) xz4002151 to indian country today newspaper , he said he would push for a compromise bill through congress that would support on-reservation tribal sovereignty against the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board , while accepting the board 's role as arbiter of labor-employee disputes and union organizing on off-reservation tribally owned business . 
the only workable bill is an authorizing bill , h.r. 16 . 
as i have pointed out , we come here with this recourse because of uncertainty and because of bureaucratic fiat . 
adopt this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
