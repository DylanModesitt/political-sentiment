mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i do not want to take a lot of time for this because i think we all know the scenario that is the result of this , but i do want to make the point again . 
what i am rising to do is to cut the level of funding in this appropriation bill by 1 percent . 
this amount equals $ 1.425 billion , which represents only one penny off of every dollar . 
this is not an across-the-board cut . 
the way it is structured , it lets the department decide where this money should come from . 
as most members are aware , i have offered a series of these amendments over many appropriation bills . 
we need to draw the line ; and the budget we have for the next year is too large , and we can do something about the deficit right now . 
by voting for my amendment , you are stating to the american taxpayers that they should not have to pay higher taxes in the future , because we can control our spending today . 
as hard as the chairman and ranking member have worked on this bill , there are still many wonderful things in the bill , very meritorious things in the bill , but things that do not have to be done , some of them . 
this fiscal year 's 2006 labor-hhs appropriations bill provides over $ 142.5 billion in total discretionary resources . 
and we have seen discretionary spending increase in this bill by an average of more than 5 percent a year over the last 5 years , even though it is less this year than it was last year . 
i commend the committee and the chairman on that . 
this bill spends $ 924 million over the president 's request . 
our budget should be no different than our individual budgets at home . 
when we have less money , we spend less money . 
i would encourage support of the hefley amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
