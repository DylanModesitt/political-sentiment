mr. chairman , i am delighted to join the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 , my distinguished chairman , in opposing this amendment . 
i think the chairman , as always , shows great wisdom in opposing this amendment . 
but i am particularly thrilled that the chairman has embraced the principle of providing our secretary of state flexibility in dealing with this issue , and i very much hope that during the course of the remaining few minutes of our debate , the chairman will see the wisdom of providing secretary rice with flexibility on similar issues . 
i thank the gentleman for yielding .
