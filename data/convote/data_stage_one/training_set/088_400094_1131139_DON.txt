mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
the argument that has been made in support of the amendment is that the price of natural gas is increased to the consumer . 
and we should address this as a congress . 
but one of the points that has been overlooked here today is that this congress passed an energy bill that provided initial financial incentives to drill in the central and western gulf , and that is a valid attempt by this congress to address this issue . 
but to open up the eastern gulf of mexico would be a terrible mistake . 
there is a very small proportion available , and what is available is right off the coast of florida . 
it has been suggested florida should follow the standards of texas with respect to our beaches . 
the beaches in florida are a pristine treasure not to be experimented with . 
the truth of the matter is nobody here on the floor of the house knows what the risk is if you drill . 
this amendment may say gas , but it is about gas and oil . 
because once you start drilling , you get what you get when you drill . 
so we should not sacrifice or risk the florida beaches or the california beaches to get a small proportion of gas that can be more easily achieved , and which this congress is promoting through deepwater drilling in the central and western coast .
