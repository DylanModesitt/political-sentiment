mr. chairman , i claim the time in opposition , although i am actually supportive of the amendment , but i had to apparently say i was opposed to get the time , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , this is a good amendment . 
it adds to the bill . 
the gentleman from arizona ( mr. shadegg ) xz4003680 offered a similar amendment in markup that was adopted . 
this goes further and establishes the program at the epa . 
the only concern , well , not concern , but i need to let the distinguished gentleman from tennessee know that this authorizes the program , it does not appropriate the funds , and it would be subject to appropriations ; but certainly , authorizing the program so that we can go to the committee on appropriations and request funding . 
there is no question , it is without question that hybrid technology extends our available full fuel resources and that it is a coming thing , and i want to thank the gentleman from tennessee for offering this amendment , and i do strongly support it . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
