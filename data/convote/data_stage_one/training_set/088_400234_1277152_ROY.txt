mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i would like to note that in response to past amendments in the same effect , the office of government ethics has said the government would be depriving itself of much of the best and most relevant outside expertise in many areas . 
the amendment would prohibit waivers for financial interests that are so insubstantial , remote , or inconsequential that they are typically permitted , even for regular full-time government employees . 
they went on to say , existing law strikes the correct balance between protecting the government from inappropriate conflicts of interest and recognizing the need for temporary experts who may have unavoidable conflicts in relevant fields of inquiry . 
i think those concerns are relevant to the hinchey amendment before us and support a `` no '' vote on this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
