mr. chairman , i yield myself 15 seconds . 
in response to the gentleman from new hampshire ( mr. bass ) xz4000190 , i show him the headline in the newspaper of a little town in my district , where they had to sue chevron for $ 9 billion for contamination of the water supply and it was settled out of court . 
they never would have gotten the settlement without the lawsuit . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 , the ranking member of the committee on energy and commerce .
