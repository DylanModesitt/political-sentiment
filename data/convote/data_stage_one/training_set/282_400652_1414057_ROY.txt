mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
as a former judge , i believe in consequences for bad conduct ; and of course when improper behavior takes place , i do not believe in saying to the perpetrator , no matter who it is , try to do a little better . 
the united nations has a history of abuse , misconduct , criminal negligence , money laundering , some corruption , and sexual violence against the very people the united nations swears to protect . 
mr. chairman , there should be consequences , and my question is who is holding the united nations accountable for that conduct . 
thanks to the leadership of the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 and the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 , and others in congress , the united states has begun the tough task of investigating the scandals which the united nations is ridden with . 
but in my opinion , the united states will never be able to hold the united nations accountable if we do not know where our aid , our money is going once we hand it over to the united nations . 
my amendment simply would require the omb to give a yearly report to congress on all the contributions , whether they be assessed , voluntary , or in-kind , that the united states gives to the united nations . 
the american taxpayers have the right to know how the united nations is spending american money . 
so by keeping track of our contributions , the united states will be more capable of holding the united nations accountable for the way it spends members ' monies and makes use of members ' contributions .
