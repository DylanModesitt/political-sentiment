mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , the amendment in the nature of a substitute completely guts this bill . 
every crippling amendment that was rejected either in this house or the other body in this congress or the previous congress is incorporated in this amendment . 
they do not have any new ideas over there . 
they just repackage and try to regurgitate the old ideas that have been found lacking . 
the issue in this bill is very clear , and that is that we have to restore some sanity to the civil justice system by dealing with the abuses that a small group of lawyers have turned the class action system into . 
when the framers of the constitution wrote that inspired document , they gave congress the power to regulate interstate congress . 
what has happened as a result of the abuse of the class action system is that judges in small out-of-the-way counties , like madison county , illinois and jefferson county , texas end up being the ultimate arbiters of interstate commerce . 
this bill puts some balance back into the system . 
the amendment perpetuates the existing system . 
vote `` no '' on the amendments , vote `` no '' on the motion to recommit , and pass the bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
