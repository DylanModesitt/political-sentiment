mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
the studies that the gentleman cites did not take a look at the top-to-bottom consolidation of the oil industry . 
there have been a number of studies , but each study has been conducted almost in a vacuum without considering the entirety , the entire scope of this problem , a problem that is putting small , independent retailers out of business and driving up prices on every street corner in america . 
we are not taking a position necessarily on the issue . 
we are simply saying it ought to be a responsibility of the federal government to investigate this situation , to talk about the marketplace . 
the other side speaks passionately about free and fair markets and competition . 
the purpose of free , fair and competitive markets is to help drive prices down . 
by opposing this amendment , we are protecting an industry which is driving prices up . 
i am deeply disappointed that the other side would take that position . 
i urge them to reconsider . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
