mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , to close , and again in opposition , i think it is unfortunate and really not necessary to put republican-democrat in the statute . 
that is really what we are trying to do ; that is what the gentleman from new york is trying to do . 
this is an issue that needs to be worked out at the leadership level , which traditionally has been the case . 
the last example that the gentleman mentioned , i do not know what all that had to do with , but i think it was above our pay grade . 
but at the same time , that is how it works , and to encase republican and democrat in the statute i think at this time would certainly not be in the best interests of the process , and that is why i continue to oppose my friend 's amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
