i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
mr. speaker , i would ask the gentleman : the bill which you just indicated would be on the floor next week and you asked for amendments to be filed in a timely fashion is a very important bill . 
it came out , as you pointed out , with overwhelming bipartisan support . 
i think you said 65-7 . 
since that time , it is my understanding that there has been some change in the bill . 
in particular , i refer to the provision which deals with the ability of those who may receive dollars under the provisions of the bill for the purposes of constructing affordable housing , that if they receive federal funds that they will be unable to thereafter participate in encouraging voter registration drives or getting more people on the rolls to vote . 
that is something that i think the whole house ought to address . 
i believe the ranking member is going to ask that that be struck from the bill so that there not be a preclusion on voter registration drives or participation . 
the catholic conference is very concerned about that . 
i would presume a number of faith-based organizations are very concerned about that provision . 
i may have a discussion briefly with the acting majority leader on that issue as well . 
but can the gentleman tell me whether or not he believes the rules committee will allow the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 to offer an amendment which would put the bill back in the position which 65 people in the committee supported at the time it was reported out . 
i thank my colleague for yielding and would ask him if he can give us some thought on that issue , which we feel very strongly about , and hope that that amendment can be protected and made in order by the committee and that we will have a full and fair debate on the floor of the house with reference to that amendment .
