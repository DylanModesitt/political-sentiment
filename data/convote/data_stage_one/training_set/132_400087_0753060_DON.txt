mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the solis amendment to the energy bill . 
this amendment ensures that the federal laws and regulations that pertain to ensuring clean air and water and a solid quality of life for our constituents are not stripped out just because they or their community is facing some economic distress . 
specifically , the solis amendment would strip out language that cynically allows refineries to move into economically distressed communities , override federal environmental laws , trample on local zoning laws and ignore community opposition to set up shop . 
the fact that this bill allows the oil companies to ride roughshod over those communities facing tough economic times is a travesty . 
urban and rural communities facing tough times can not and should not serve as dumping grounds for the oil industry . 
just because a community is facing an economic downturn is no reason to say that population can now be exposed to refineries and their byproducts in their community -- and that these people do not deserve the protections of the clear air act as just one example . 
the house has the opportunity to strip out the special rights and ensure equal rights for all of our constituents . 
while i represent new york city and do not see any oil refineries planning to set up shop there any time soon , this amendment is an attack on all communities facing tough times and will lead to greater victimization of people suffering . 
please support the solis amendment and strip out the damaging special rights for refineries in this bill .
