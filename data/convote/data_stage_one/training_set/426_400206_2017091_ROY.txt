mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , we do not know the cost . 
it is going to be out of reason , i believe . 
and while ahp legislation will be implemented quickly , this democrat substitute might take years to get up and running . 
in addition , the funds are subject to appropriations . 
and if an appropriation did not go through or did not provide enough funds , small employers and their workers would be left hanging . 
let me make myself clear . 
i believe our nation 's employer-sponsored health care system is a success story . 
employers provide coverage for the vast majority of our nation 's population ; 131 million americans obtain their coverage from private employers . 
the committee on education and the workforce and the department of labor through our oversight of erisa have jurisdiction over employer-sponsored health care . 
so i support using the employer-based system to address the problems of the uninsured . 
however , the way to do that is to build on the success of the current system by utilizing the strengths that enable large employers and unions to offer cadillac health plans . 
ahps are the way to do that . 
vote down this amendment . 
vote for ahps . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
