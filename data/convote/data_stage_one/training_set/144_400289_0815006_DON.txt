mr. speaker , i would like to ask if the distinguished chairman wishes to repeat his tactic of last week of waiting until everybody else has spoken and then mischaracterize what we have said so that we can not reply to him . 
is that his intent today ? 
is that why he is reserving his time now so that he can speak after everybody else has spoken ?
