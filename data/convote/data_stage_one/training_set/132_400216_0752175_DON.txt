mr. chairman , i rise today to oppose the boehlert-markey amendment to the energy bill . 
this unnecessary amendment would hurt our already struggling economy . 
it threatens the jobs of workers in flint , bay city , saginaw , and other communities in my congressional district and in my home state of michigan . 
it undermines the hard work of our auto companies and auto workers that is being made through the investment of billions of dollars in alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles . 
the drastic increases called for in this amendment would have negative consequences for passenger safety and consumer choice . 
the national highway traffic safety administration has increased cafe standards , which is their obligation . 
clearly , the current process , mr. chairman , is working . 
opposing this amendment protects jobs , passenger safety , consumer choice , and advancing auto technology . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment .
