mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
i heard my good friend from colorado ( mr. tancredo ) xz4003940 say that this amendment likely will not pass , but i hope maybe the debate will seek and help to convince him of the enormity of the crisis or at least the need in places like sri lanka , indonesia and many other countries that are impacted by the tsunami . 
if i might draw the gentleman 's memory to the video that showed a single train that had been the lifeline of sri lanka , an opportunity that i took in visiting sri lanka with a number of my colleagues , to see the enormous devastation in terms of the infrastructure of these countries , then the gentleman would realize that in addition to the charitable heart that americans have and the private contributions that have been made , and might i acknowledge the many donations given from the city of houston and the houston tsunami relief effort and the vietnamese relief effort and sri lankans and those from thailand and many , many others in the city of houston and the effort waged by president clinton and president bush , and in my community , jim mackinvale , and many others who worked hard to draw monies out of houston , and i know many other cities and states did the same . 
but the infrastructure dollars are so very important . 
so i would hope that my colleagues would oppose this amendment because you can not imagine , i believe , the depth of the amendment and the need to rebuild those countries , and those dollars will help to do so .
