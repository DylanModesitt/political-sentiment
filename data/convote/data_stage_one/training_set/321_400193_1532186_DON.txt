mr. chairman , those who believe in privacy and not being dictated to by the u.s. congress in their most private , intimate decisions should vote against this amendment . 
two friends of mine my age recently went in for prostate treatment . 
when you go in for prostate cancer , they tell you you have a choice of various alternatives . 
some may give you a higher chance of survival , but also a higher chance of impotency . 
a university of chicago study showed that if you tell men that they have a chance of impotency that can not be cured because you do not have access to these ed drugs , they will , 68 percent of the time , take surgery that could lessen their chances of survival . 
this is not recreation . 
these are helping men make decisions that are going to help prolong their lives . 
we should reject this amendment .
