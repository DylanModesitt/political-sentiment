mr. chairman , i yield myself the remaining time . 
i thank the chairman for his support and ask all of my colleagues in both parties to be supportive of it . 
just to point out one last thing , i appreciate the chairman pointing out that this authorizes the program , and forgive me for not making that point clear , as well as the fact that the epa will administer this program . 
finally , as my colleagues know , the budget measure that president bush proposed would grant about $ 7 billion , a little over $ 7 billion , in tax breaks ; and a good 70 percent of that would go towards energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy . 
i believe that this amendment advances that goal , not only for the president but , more importantly , for the country . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
