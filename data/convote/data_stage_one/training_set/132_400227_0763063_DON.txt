mr. chairman , i rise in support of the israel amendment . 
in cleveland , ohio , my district , people do not understand why prices vary from street to street . 
they can drive around and see a gas station will have $ 2.25 and a couple blocks later it will be $ 2.35 . 
the gentleman 's study is so important because it will provide some insight into pricing , into how the market is set up ; and the small and independent gas station owners who are getting squeezed in the market are going to have their cause elevated .
