mr. speaker , if the gentleman will continue to yield , i would assume that the committee on rules would follow a process similar to the one that they followed for the rest of the 9/11 commission 's recommendations , and that is to have a structured rule that allows for a variety of amendments . 
but i will let the chairman of the committee on rules make announcements on that and reserve decisions for the committee on what those amendments will be . 
i can tell the gentleman that we are contemplating , although actions by the committee on rules will need to be taken , contemplating a rule that would merge the border security bill into another bill , another must-pass piece of legislation , not knowing what that would be . 
but , obviously , the supplement could be a candidate for that .
