mr. chairman , the congressional black caucus has carefully considered its responsibility here , and they have asked me to point out a couple of things . 
in the justice department we need to put more money into three programs that were cut : first , the programs that investigate gang-related crimes ; secondly , the problems of juvenile delinquency ; and , third , prison reentry . 
these are incredibly important . 
and i just want to add that this budget that we are trying to replace ours with is one of the most mean-spirited documents that i have witnessed . 
over 150 domestic program cuts . 
the $ 81 billion for iraq was not even included in this budget , as if it was a supplemental consideration . 
so i ask the members to join with us and let us have a great number of people supporting the cbc budget this year .
