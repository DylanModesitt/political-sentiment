mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i appreciate the gentleman 's observation . 
my presumption is then , mr. chairman , before he leaves the floor , my presumption would be , for the members of the house and also for the members of the committee on appropriations , that the committee on appropriations will proceed as if the house numbers were the numbers ? 
am i correct on that ? 
i yield to the gentleman .
