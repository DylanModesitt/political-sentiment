mr. speaker , it is interesting to hear the distinguished gentleman from georgia mention the committee on rules , and i respect the power of the committee on rules . 
the committee on rules is not a jurisdictional committee . 
this bill did not go through the committee process on the senate side or on the house side . 
i might also say when we talk about coupons and the amount of dollars that lawyers may receive , might i remind the body that we are talking about thousands upon thousands of plaintiffs in a class action who would never have their grievances addressed and the corporate culprit would have never been punished had it not been for this class action . 
so to manipulate it to suggest that it is abused is manipulation , just that . 
this did not go through the committee process . 
we are avoiding the committee process . 
therefore , we are stamping on democracy and this rule and this bill should be voted down enthusiastically .
