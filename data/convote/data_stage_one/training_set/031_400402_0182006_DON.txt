mr. chairman , a better amendment title for this amendment would be the bounty hunter act of 2005 . 
the amendment gives bail bondsmen authority to round up illegal immigrants and to have them deported without any sort of hearing or due process rights . 
this amendment would not make our homeland any safer or keep terrorists out . 
instead , it would endanger civil rights and create fear in the immigrant community . 
we should not outsource the department of homeland security 's job to a bunch of bounty hunters . 
as already has been said , the fugitive slave act of 1850 has very similar language to this amendment . 
and for those members who have not suffered from the ills of slavery and what people went through , i want to share and encourage you to look at this amendment very clearly before it comes to a vote . 
let us give the department of homeland security the 2 , 000 employees that we authorized for border security , not 2 , 000 bounty hunters . 
this is not a reality program . 
people will not be watching it on tv . 
we are turning over the department of homeland security 's enforcement responsibility to bounty hunters , people who have no training whatsoever , who absolutely can and possibly will infringe on civil rights of the people of this country . 
mr. chairman , i encourage absolute opposition to this amendment .
