mr. speaker , i yield myself 15 seconds to respond to my distinguished colleague from massachusetts who referenced three editorial boards . 
i think it is important to note that these editorial boards are nothing more than paid scribes . 
they literally make their living by using the first amendment . 
but everyone knows that the internet has negatively affected the cash flow of the institutional print media . 
it is the height of hypocrisy for the print media to use their right to free speech to opine against their competition on the internet . 
mr. speaker , i yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from texas ( mr. hensarling ) xz4001750 .
