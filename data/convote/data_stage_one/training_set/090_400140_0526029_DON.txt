mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute . 
the caption tonight ought to be `` we are not doctors . 
we just play them on c-span. '' the point is this : the gentleman is making specific medical arguments . 
he has said , in strong criticism of the entire judicial system of the state of florida , that they did not give her a fair chance ; that the entire judicial system , all of those appeals , all of those trials , all of that litigation , that that did not give her a fair chance and we will now vacate the judgment of florida . 
and why ? 
not because any of us know one thing or another , but because many members here genuinely have a strong ideological interest , and that is precisely why this ought to be a judicial decision and not a legislative decision . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. moran ) xz4002831 .
