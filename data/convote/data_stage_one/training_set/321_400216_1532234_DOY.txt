mr. chairman , i claim time in opposition . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i might consume . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
last year , members from both sides of the aisle voted down a similar amendment . 
i had hoped that in a year 's time the gentleman from arizona ( mr. hayworth ) xz4001730 and the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 would work together to address this issue in the committee of jurisdiction . 
but that did not occur . 
the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 and i have had discussions on scheduling hearings in the committee of jurisdiction , the committee on education and the workforce . 
during my 40 years of public service , i have established a strong record for defending the sovereign rights of indian tribes . 
i have often led the fight to defeat legislative riders on appropriation bills because of my confidence in the regular procedures guiding us through the legislative process . 
& lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h5140 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; i am committed to finding a permanent solution to this issue , but the appropriations process is not the way to solve this issue . 
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the hayworth amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
