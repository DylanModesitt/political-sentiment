mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the democrat substitute . 
this proposal actually does not continue some very important provisions for low income americans . 
it does not extend a savers credit which actually allows a match for savings for poorer people by the government . 
their substitute does not include an expensing provision for small businesses that allows them to use more of their money instead of sending it to the government so that they can grow their business and create jobs . 
it does not allow a provision that provides tax benefits to those who clean up brownfield sites to encourage new job creation in some of our older towns . 
it does not include the most important provision , which is the reduced rate on capital gains and dividends that has created all of these new jobs . 
now , you do not have to be an economist to understand these lines . 
on the left-hand side , you see all the bars below the line . 
on the right-hand side , all the bars are above the line . 
and what do those bars represent ? 
well , on the first half it is from january 2001 until we passed the capital gains and dividends tax reductions . 
interestingly enough , taxes were high , investment was low . 
these bars show job losses . 
all of the bars underneath the line are job losses . 
we passed the capital gains cut , the dividends cut , what happens ? 
businesses save more of their money , reinvest , create jobs . 
all the bars above the line , they show an average job gain , per month , since we passed the capital gains and dividends cuts of 148 , 700 jobs . 
that is just an average . 
as you can see , some months were higher than others , but across the board we created almost 150 , 000 jobs a month as a result of a provision that the democrat substitute would cancel . 
i urge my colleagues to cancel the democrat substitute .
