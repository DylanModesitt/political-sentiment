mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i just want to say that we are supporting all forms of energy . 
we accepted amendments in the committee for animal methane , livestock methane . 
this is a pilot program . 
it is a nominal amount of dollars . 
i honestly do not know whether sugar cane will be economical to turn into ethanol , but it is well worth the 3-year pilot program to see if it is . 
i actually hope that it is . 
i would want it to be successful . 
but this is a very , very small , nominal program . 
and i would also point out there are not many states that can grow sugar cane . 
hawaii would be one . 
i guess florida would be one . 
perhaps louisiana . 
maybe even texas , although i do not think we have . 
so i would hope we would support the abercrombie amendment .
