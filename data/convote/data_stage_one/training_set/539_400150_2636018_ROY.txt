mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman from texas for yielding . 
i rise in support of the rule , rise in support of the bill , and i also want to note that government-sponsored enterprise reform is way overdue , and it does pose a systemic risk to our financial system . 
also i want to commend chairman oxley , chairman baker and also ranking member frank for all of the work they have put into bringing this bill to this point . 
mr. speaker , i would like to discuss briefly an amendment that i had offered that was adopted by the committee by voice vote back in may . 
that amendment adds an important disclosure requirement to ensure that shareholders are fully informed on the charitable giving practices of fannie mae and freddie mac . 
the language would authorize the federal housing finance agency to require that fannie mae and freddie mac make publicly available each year the total value of contributions made to nonprofit organizations during the previous fiscal year , and it would also request specific disclosures on donations to insider-affiliated charities . 
the housing gses , fannie mae and freddie mac , were established by congressional charter and give special privileges to provide a service to the american people by creating a secondary mortgage market and increasing liquidity . 
given their unique status and responsibility to improve access to the housing market , it is both their shareholders ' and the public 's right to know how these profits are being spent .
