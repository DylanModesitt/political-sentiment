mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
just 18 days before united dumped its pension plans into the pbgc , the pbgc wrote and said that it would be in the best interest of the participants and the pension plan insurance program would be best served by the continuance of the flight attendants pension plan . 
united got up in the middle of the night , unilaterally threw this in . 
what we are trying to tell united is go to the marketplace , go look for private solutions to this debt , get this debt covered , people do it all the time . 
companies do it all the time , countries do it all the time , before they come to the taxpayer . 
the gentleman from virginia ( mr. moran ) xz4002831 is right . 
we may very well be looking at the opening night act of a new savings and loan scandal because we let these people come in , because they unilaterally decided termination was their first choice , going to the taxpayer was their first choice . 
it should be their last choice . 
this amendment simply says go back to the bargaining table and exhaust all of their remedies before they come to the taxpayer . 
vote for the miller-schakowsky-crowley amendment and take care of people who play by the rules .
