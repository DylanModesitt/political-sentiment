mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit . 
i thought i had heard everything this morning , mr. speaker , when , in the debate , we heard the opponents of this bill say that they felt that they could fight violent gang crime better by using arts and crafts than they could by locking up violent criminals , but i am shocked now that they are even bringing in iraq . 
if you look , mr. speaker , the department of justice , i am sure , is going to investigate the matters that are in this motion to recommit . 
there has not been a shred of evidence or testimony in any subcommittee or full committee about this bill related to anything in this motion to recommit . 
we have not heard a single discussion on it on the floor today . 
we have heard one poison pill after another to try to stop us from going after violent criminal gangs . 
there have even been amendments to try to offer loans to gang members , to give housing to violent gang members . 
mr. speaker , it is time we stopped playing games with this bill and we pass it and go on to try to deal with these violent gangs . 
i want to remind the house that the fraternal order of police , the national association of police organizations , the national sheriffs association , the major county sheriffs association , the law enforcement alliance of america , national troopers coalition , federal criminal investigators association , california gang investigators association , national latino peace officers association , the new orleans district attorney , the los angeles deputy sheriffs , and 63 chiefs of major police departments around the country support the bill as it is . 
i hope we will defeat the motion to recommit and pass h.r. 1279 .
