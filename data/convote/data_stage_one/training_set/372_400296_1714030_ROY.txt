mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
it has been a long 4 hours on four bills . 
we stayed on the subject for about 2 hours . 
these four bills are very important , i believe , for the small business community in the country . 
i realize that the labor union kingpins do not like these four bills , but i promise labor union workers who are out there in small businesses will like these bills . 
there have been some outlandish statements that need to be corrected for the record . 
number one , there is nobody on our committee , including myself , any of us who made these bills , that believe for one minute any of these bills are going to harm the workplace safety or health factor . 
it is simply not going to do that . 
somebody said , oh , gosh , if we pass these bills , workers will have more injuries . 
members can have that opinion ; it does not make it right . 
that is simply not true . 
somebody said , if you pass these four bills , you are going to weaken osha . 
that is not true either . 
we are going to help make osha work a little better . 
lastly , i want to mention to my friend who said osha is a federal cop . 
that is the problem . 
if you believe they are a bunch of police over there , we never will get anywhere with osha because until we get this federal agency working with people in small businesses who want to have a safer workplace rather than a bunch of cops who come around and beat people up , this is never going to work . 
i had this happen just yesterday in my own district where this female came in , and her badge was bigger than her brain . 
it was just ridiculous . 
until we get a different attitude and not feeling that osha is a federal cop , it is not going to get better . 
mr. speaker , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , chairman of the committee on education and the workforce .
