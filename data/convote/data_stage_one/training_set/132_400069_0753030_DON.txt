mr. chairman , let me make four quick points on this amendment . 
first of all , i completely and wholeheartedly support it . 
second , the credit for this amendment goes to my colleague and the senior democrat , the gentleman from hawaii ( mr. abercrombie ) xz4000010 who i thank . 
since i have almost all of the agriculture in my particular district , this shows teamwork . 
third , this morning , in kahalui , maui , the price of a premium gallon of gas was $ 2.98 per gallon . 
across the street from that gas station , stands one of the most highest yield sugar plantations in the whole world , a sugar plantation that is threatened across the way , threatened across the board . 
if we can produce ethanol from that sugar plantation , we can kill a bunch of birds with one stone . 
we can preserve agriculture in this country . 
this is revolutionary . 
if we can produce meaningful energy from prickly pears , or whatever you want , from sugar , all power to it ; it is going to work for all of us . 
if we can save the sugar industry by producing energy from the sugar industry , it will be good for us , and it will be good for many of the other issues that we care so much about . 
i urge adoption of this amendment .
