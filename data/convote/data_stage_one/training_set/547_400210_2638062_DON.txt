mr. chairman , i think we have debated a tough issue . 
i am sure there are people on the other side that understand why we feel so strongly on this faith-based issue . 
we have maybe a chance to resolve this and come out of this house with a resounding victory . 
if we vote down the manager 's amendment , we will include the entire manager 's amendment in the motion to recommit with three exceptions . 
we will take out that the prime purpose has to be housing , so faith-based organizations can still consider god as a primary challenge and obligation . 
secondly , we will add in the terms that will allow for voter registration and get-out-the vote on a nonpartisan basis . 
so this will only affect getting out the vote and voter registration in a nonpartisan way . 
finally , what i urge my colleagues on the other side to do is vote down the manager 's amendment , accept the motion to recommit , have a perfect bill that we can walk out of here today with almost a unanimous approval .
