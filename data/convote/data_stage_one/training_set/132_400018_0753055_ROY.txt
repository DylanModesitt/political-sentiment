mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of the time . 
again , i oppose the solis amendment . 
i was at the white house earlier this week and was briefing the president on the energy bill that came out of the various committees ; and when i mentioned this particular element , which i consider to be an important element of the bill , something that we did not have in last year 's bill , his initial , off-the-cuff reaction was , a , it was very good ; and , b , could we add abandoned military bases . 
obviously , it is not in order to change the amendment on the floor , but when we go to conference , if the president decides that the official position of the white house is to support the amendment plus add abandoned military bases , we will have a debate in the conference and hopefully add that . 
but the bottom line on this is we need more refinery capacity . 
we need it in this country . 
why not put it at old refinery sites or old manufacturing sites where they have high unemployment and we can create some good jobs for america , and oh , yes , by the way , most of these jobs will be union jobs . 
i would urge a `` no '' vote on the solis amendment . 
let us vote for jobs in america . 
mr. chairman , i yield back my time .
