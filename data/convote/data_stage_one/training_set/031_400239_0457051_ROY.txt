mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment in no small part because essentially the tierney amendment would be changing the rules of the house . 
that is above the purview of the committee on appropriations , at least of this chairman of the committee on appropriations . 
because of that , i would oppose the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i withdraw my point of order .
