mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from north carolina for yielding me this time . 
i want to make a couple of comments as we wrap up . 
one is the massive tax increase . 
what we did was started with the base budget , the republican budget . 
on income we changed the revenue by rolling back the tax cuts to the level they were at in 2001 for income over 200 , 000 . 
if someone makes more than $ 200 , 000 , they get all the income tax cuts up to the 200 , 000 , but no tax cuts after 200 , 000 . 
again , we spend $ 167 billion less deficit than the republican budget , creating $ 27 billion less in interest payments . 
now , we have heard all of this about massive cuts in defense . 
let us be very clear . 
all of the numbers on defense are exactly the same numbers as the republican budget , with one exception . 
we fund missile defense at $ 1 billion rather than $ 8.8 billion . 
if you look at defense , homeland security , and veterans , that total is the same because we use that money to fund defense , homeland security and veterans . 
now , on defense , i hope the gentleman from florida is working with the virginia delegation in maintaining a 12-aircraft carrier fleet . 
this budget , the congressional black caucus budget , has a billion dollars more in shipbuilding than the underlying budget . 
we have $ 75 million more in shipbuilding than the underlying budget . 
we have $ 75 million more in body armor . 
we have in homeland security , $ 500 million for port security ; $ 100 million for rail security , veterans benefits . 
those charts did not show what the present level of services would cost . 
it also did not show the fact that the republican budget has co-pays and deductibles that our budget does not have . 
we say we have $ 4 billion more for veterans , over $ 1 billion more for shipbuilding , over $ 2 billion more for homeland security . 
so if you look at that as a group , we are more secure with the congressional black caucus budget than the republican budget . 
i would hope that we would adopt the budget . 
it saves money and makes us more secure . 
i include for the record the fiscal year 2006 cbc alternative budget breakdown : working off the chairman 's mark , as amended , all calculations are for changes above/below proposed fiscal year 2006 levels . 
on behalf of the congressional black caucus , this amendment in the nature of a substitute seeks to offer to congress and the american people an alternative budget that is fiscally responsible and aimed at reducing disparities in our communities . 
the cbc alternative budget raises revenue by reducing the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 for an individual 's adjusted gross income that exceeds $ 200 , 000 and not adopting the new republican tax cuts , eliminating corporate tax incentives for off-shoring jobs , closing tax loopholes , abusive shelters , and methods of tax avoidance , and eliminating the repeal of the limitation on itemized deductions ( pease ) and the phase-out of personal exemptions ( pep ) scheduled to take place between 2006 and 2010 . 
these funds total an estimated $ 36.3 billion in fy 2006 . 
the cbc budget uses nearly $ 4 billion of these additional revenues for deficit reduction . 
the remaining funds are used to restore cuts and fund increases in specific budget function areas . 
these include full funding for no child left behind and providing funds in addition , the cbc alternative budget reduces funding for the ballistic missile defense program by $ 7.8 billion . 
the cbc alternative budget reallocates all of this money for additional support for the troops in iraq and other defense items necessary to maintain our military strength and jobs , homeland security needs , and veterans programs and benefits . 
i . 
revenue raisers and defense reallocation [ in billions ] & lt ; p & gt ; general revenue raisers a reduction in the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 for an individual 's adjusted gross income that exceeds $ 200 , 000 ; furthermore , the cbc budget alternative does not adopt the new republican tax cuts . 
eliminating corporate tax incentives for off-shoring jobs . 
the closing tax loopholes category includes closing abusive ( tax ) shelters and methods of tax avoidance . 
eliminating the repeal of the limitation on itemized deductions ( pease ) and the phase-out of personal exemptions ( pep ) scheduled to take place between 2006 and 2010 . 
the cbc budget applies nearly $ 4 billion out of the general revenue to deficit reduction in fiscal year 2006 . 
defense reallocation the cost of the ballistic missile defense program is $ 8.8 billion in fiscal year 2006 . 
this budget leaves $ 1 billion in that program for research and development . 
all of the funds reduced from that program are then reallocated to additional support for the troops in iraq and other defense items necessary to maintain our military strength and jobs , homeland security needs ( under the general allowances function ) , and veterans programs and benefits . 
all functions except function 050 ( national defense ) , function 700 ( veterans ) , and function 920 ( allowances ) . 
all calculations are for changes above/below proposed fiscal year 2006 levels included in the republican budget .
