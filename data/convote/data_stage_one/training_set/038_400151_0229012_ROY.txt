mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to address the remarks of the gentlewoman from texas . 
i want to remind her that the committee on rules voted unanimously in favor of this rule and granted an amendment in order in the form of a substitute that includes each and every one of the provisions that she just spoke of . 
i also would like to remind my colleagues that each and every one of those amendments were also proffered in the other body , and each and every one of those amendments were voted down in a strong bipartisan vote . 
so to suggest , mr. speaker , that this is something that had not been looked at and we have not talked about , i would remind my colleague that it was addressed in the 105th congress , in the 106th congress , in the 107th congress , in the 108th congress , and finally we are here , and we are going to get this rule passed and this bill passed and on to the president for his signature . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr. cole ) xz4000770 , my colleague on the committee on rules .
