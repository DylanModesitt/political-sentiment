mr. speaker , i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 3893 , the gasoline for america 's security act of 2005 . 
this legislation will do nothing to lower the high cost of gas or help families pay for home heating oil this winter . 
rather , it 's another taxpayer subsidy from the republican majority to the oil and gas companies while the american people continue to face the increasing burdens that the rising cost of fuel is placing on family budgets . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation .
