mr. speaker , as we worked on this on the committee on education and the workforce , we tried to put our thoughts into it . 
people have to understand , if the main bill is passed , health care for our small employers is not going to help the majority of those employees seeking coverage . 
the recommittal goes back to what the states have already done , mainly because in the beginning the insurance companies would not give health care to women that needed to have a mammogram or to have a pap smear to make sure they do not have cervical cancer . 
this house spends money constantly on cancer research , and here we are using a tool that we can prevent cancer and make sure that women are treated earlier . 
with this bill , the mainline bill is taking that away . 
i ask my colleagues , do not be fooled , stand up for your state . 
stand up for the health care of your constituents . 
that is what our job is .
