mr. chairman , i rise in support of the bonilla provision to delay implementing mandatory country of origin labeling , which is known as cool , for meat and meat products for 1 year . 
this distinction is important . 
this delay is for meat and associated products alone . 
in the 2002 farm bill , we added the cool requirement for fruits and vegetables . 
the conference , however , expanded the mandate to meat , fish , perishable agricultural commodities , and peanuts . 
as most things not vetted by committees , these regulations brought a number of problems and unintended consequences . 
several government and private studies have identified numerous costs added , especially for consumers . 
american families should not pay the price for marketing beef without it being any safer than it is now . 
the house has previously voted to delay mandatory cool in order to review the law and develop a voluntary option . 
the bonilla provision to delay cool labeling for meat is the right thing to do . 
i ask the house to join me in keeping this provision and oppose the motion to strike .
