mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i simply want to say institutions , no matter what they are , whether they are tribe or any other institution , they have a capacity to violate human rights . 
and with the gentleman 's amendment , you will be opening a loophole in the law as big as a 65-foot truck . 
this amendment is a terrible amendment . 
it ought to be buried in a box and we ought to pretend it never was presented . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
