mr. chairman , i rise in support of the miller amendment . 
mr. chairman , employees and retirees at united airlines played by the rules and deserve what they expected -- a solid pension payment to support their retirement years . 
but instead of the promised income they were counting on to help cover their kid 's college tuition ; their own health care ; or , the mortgage payments on their houses , they were left with a court ruling dumping their dreams into the pension guaranty benefit corporation ( pbgc ) , which is significantly less than what they were counting on . 
and , guess who fools the bill ? 
-- the tax payers ! 
over 2 , 000 email statements from united workers were recently submitted into an e-hearing conducted by representatives george miller and jan schakowsky . 
one of my constituents , ms. elenor barcsak wrote : `` i worked for united airlines as a flight attendant for 37 years ... .. 
when i turned 60 years old i was told that it would be totally safe to retire as my pension , that i had paid into as a union member for all those years , was totally protected . 
she continued -- i am a homeowner in marin county since 1972 but i still have mortgage payments . 
i am assisting my family financially as my mother is in a nursing home [ in canada ] and my younger sister has been on welfare . 
the impact of my pension check being reduced by as much as half will be devastating. '' mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to support the miller amendment to prevent united airlines from dumping its pension into the pbgc and reducing the benefits promised to these loyal workers .
