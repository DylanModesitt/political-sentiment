mr. chairman , i support this amendment not just for the compelling reasons of the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , but because if it is allowed to stand as a precedent , it will cost the american taxpayer tens of billions of dollars in additional pension costs . 
support the american taxpayer and support the miller amendment .
