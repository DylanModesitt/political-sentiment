mr. chairman , i want to make clear that i assume good faith on the part of the white house , and i hope we can work things out . 
but if we do not , i will be pursuing every possible avenue to see that an amendment such as this is adopted because this congress has an obligation to know what is happening in some of these covert and clandestine operations . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment .
