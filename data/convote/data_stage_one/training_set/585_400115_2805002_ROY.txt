i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
obviously , the house has completed its work for the day and for the week . 
we will convene at 12 : 30 on monday for morning hour and at 2 p.m . 
for legislative business . 
we will consider several measures under suspension of the rules . 
a final list of those measures to be scheduled will be getting to members ' offices by the end of the day . 
any votes that may be called on those measures will be rolled until 6 : 30 monday afternoon or early monday evening . 
for tuesday and the balance of the week , if the gentleman will continue to yield , the house will consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules , as well as two measures , the one i just mentioned , h.r. 1751 , and i announced the filing of amendments for that , and also the deficit reduction act of 2005 , which is much talked about here . 
we also anticipate that the house will next week consider additional appropriations conference reports as they become available . 
on friday , we will not be in session , as members know , so that there will be an opportunity for all of us to participate in veterans ' day ceremonies that take place in our districts . 
mr. speaker , i thank my friend for yielding ; and i would be happy to entertain any questions he might have .
