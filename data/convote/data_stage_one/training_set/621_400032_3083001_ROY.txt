mr. speaker , at this time , i would like to yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina for a couple of minutes . 
she is going to talk with us about her time on the road this week with the president as the president visited in her area in north carolina , and she had the opportunity to not only talk tax reforms with the president , but to listen to her constituents in north carolina and to hear what was on their mind as they enjoyed that visit and as they had prepared for that visit . 
at this time , i yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms. foxx ) xz4006430 .
