mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman 's courtesy in yielding me this time and permitting me to speak on this and for his bringing this forward . 
it is an example of where we can take steps forward to deal with how we put the pieces together in terms of transportation . 
intelligent transportation has tremendous potential for energy savings , to put money back in the pockets of taxpayers and consumers around the country ; and it is an example that we do not have to make this equation quite as hard as we tend to on the floor of the house . 
this , i hope , is going to lead to a broader sense of application about how we squeeze more value . 
i appreciate the gentleman 's leadership in focusing on the notion of the $ 800 billion that is spent dealing with energy in this country . 
that is $ 800 billion ; yet the amount of money that is spent in research for government and for the private sector is arguably less than 1 percent , less than for any other major sector of our economy . 
i appreciate my colleague 's leadership in focusing on what impact research and technology can have in this critical area . 
by focusing on intelligent transportation , it will be one important area of research application that will make a difference for millions of americans , it will save hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel , and it will improve the quality of life for our communities in the offing . 
this is the sort of approach that will truly make our communities more livable , make our families safer , healthier , and more economically secure . 
i appreciate the gentleman 's leadership and strongly urge the adoption of this amendment .
