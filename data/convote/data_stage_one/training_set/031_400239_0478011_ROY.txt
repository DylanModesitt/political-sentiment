mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the gentleman 's amendment is most intriguing . 
the gentleman is interested in having opportunity for veterans to gain employment . 
i presume they are veterans , whether veterans of world war ii or circumstances in iraq or otherwise . 
i presume that is the case . 
i certainly would be supportive of ensuring every veteran has an opportunity to find work , wherever the veteran might have served . 
i would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman . 
yesterday we had a discussion on the floor of the house relative to the gentleman 's wanting to ensure there were additional funding flows for veterans . 
there was some resistance to that suggestion because some of us thought there was money in the pipeline that adequately serviced the hospitals ; and in regular order we would make sure whatever was necessary would be available , at future hearings and markups of bills that affect funding . 
so i want to ask a question : there is a veterans hospital in san diego county , is there not ?
