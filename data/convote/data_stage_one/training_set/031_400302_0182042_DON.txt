mr. chairman , let me thank the gentleman from arizona ( mr. kolbe ) xz4002260 , my good friend , for introducing this amendment , but i would like to touch on another area that is also very , very important . 
let me say that the border patrol need all the help that they can get . 
we have another serious problem that i hope that we can touch on , and that is what is known as the otms , or other than mexicans . 
my district includes a portion of the mcallen border patrol sector . 
last year , in the fiscal year , almost 17 , 000 otms came across through that border patrol sector , representing at least anywhere from 76 to 80 countries coming across into the united states . 
this worries me about the security of this country . 
as i talk to the border patrol officials , they know one thing , that we do not have sufficient detention facilities . 
so what happens to them ? 
they come across . 
they do not have to be picked up by the border patrol . 
they surrender themselves to the border patrol and say , i am from colombia , i am from egypt , i am from any other country ; and they know that they do not have sufficient facilities . 
so what happens ? 
they go and process these individuals , and they come in clusters from mexico . 
when they come across , it takes 10 , 12 , 15 border patrol people to come and bring them to the facilities to process them . 
it takes 2 1/2 hours to do that . 
when this happens , in the meantime , the border is completely open , because those border patrol people were removed to process these individuals . 
what happens next ? 
after the 2 1/2 hours , they go and take them to the bus station , and they give them a little piece of paper that says , you are supposed to appear on the 15th of whatever month , 60 to 90 days from now . 
one of these guys just finished paying $ 900 to be brought across . 
do my colleagues think he is going to come in ? 
this is another issue that we need to study about .
