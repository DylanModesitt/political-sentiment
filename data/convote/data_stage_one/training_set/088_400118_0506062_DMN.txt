mr. chairman , the american people and america 's veterans deserve to know the fact . 
the fact is that the republican budget being pushed during a time of war would cut veterans benefits compared to today 's services by $ 14 billion over 5 years . 
this bill is inadequate , and it is unconscionable in its treatment of veterans . 
but do not believe me ; that is what america 's veterans leaders have said about it . 
they have called it `` grossly inadequate '' and `` unconscionable. '' this came from the disabled american veterans and the veterans of foreign wars , two nonpartisan organizations . 
maybe republican leaders do not like it when veterans leaders point out the truth , but it is the truth . 
i am deeply disappointed that during a time of war we would have members of this house pay lip service to the service of our veterans ; but yet when it comes to what really counts , supporting medical care , they are going to cut it by $ 14 billion . 
that is 2 million veterans who will not receive health care under this budget . 
vote for the spratt amendment . 
mr. chairman , i include the following correspondence for the record : the independent budget , march 17 , 2005 . 
dear representative nussle : as you know , the president 's fiscal year 2006 budget would provide an appropriation for veterans ' medical care that is less than one-half of one percent above the fy 2005 appropriation . 
because this amount would not begin to cover employee wage increases and other inflationary costs , it amounts to a substantial cut in funding and thus would unavoidably result in a reduction of critical medical care services for our nation 's sick and disabled veterans . 
although we appreciate the adoption of the bradley amendment which added $ 229 million to the president 's recommendation for veterans ' medical care , this is still grossly inadequate . 
in addition , we understand that h. con . 
res. 95 includes instructions to cut spending on mandatory veterans ' programs , such as disability compensation , by $ 798 million . 
we think cutting veterans ' benefit programs is unconscionable , especially at a time when america 's sons and daughters are being wounded and killed every day in iraq . 
the four major veterans organizations of the independent budget , amvets , disabled american veterans , paralyzed veterans of america , and veterans of foreign wars of the united states , therefore strongly urge support for amendments offered by representatives spratt and obey to increase funding for veterans ' programs . 
passage of these amendments is crucial if the va is to maintain an adequate level of health care and other services . 
sincerely , & lt ; center & gt ; rick jones , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; national legislative director , amvets. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; richard b. fuller , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; national legislative director , paralyzed veterans of america. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; joseph a. violante , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; national legislative director , disabled american veterans. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; dennis cullinan , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; national legislative director , veterans of foreign wars of the united states. & lt ; /em & gt ; the american legion , washington , dc , march 17 , 2005 . 
dear mr . 
chairman : the american legion is deeply troubled with and can not support your committee 's proposed budget resolution , h. con . 
res. 95 , with regard to funding for the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , especially the reconciliation instructions targeted at earned veterans ' benefits . 
reducing mandatory appropriations for veterans ' disability compensation , pensions , and educational benefits at a time of war is inconsistent with the thanks of a grateful nation . 
the american legion believes va 's own admission that the cost of doing business increases annually about 13-14 percent because of federal pay increases and inflation in the health care arena . 
the president 's budget request is `` scrubbed '' by the office of management and budget , so va 's true fiscal requirements to meet the health care needs of america 's veterans are somewhat skewed . 
during the 108th congress , former va secretary principi reported to your colleagues that the fy 2005 proposed budget was $ 1.2 billion short of what he had actually requested . 
it appears this pattern of shortchanging va medical care continues in the 109th congress . 
america 's veterans and their families deserve better . 
the american legion recognizes and appreciates the bradley amendment adopted by the committee , but believes it falls well short of the total funding needed in va medical care . 
unfortunately , the committee rejected the edwards amendment that would have provided va with adequate resources to maintain current services . 
the american legion would encourage adoption of one of the amendments to be offered by representatives spratt or obey with regard to increasing va funding . 
clearly , both of these amendments are in the best interest of veterans and their families . 
without adoption of one of these two amendments , the american legion can not support this budget resolution . 
the american legion appreciates your leadership and the hard work of your colleagues on behalf of america 's veterans and their families . 
sincerely , thomas p. cadmus ,
