mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , before i yield to the gentlewoman from texas , i just want to respond to my colleague from oklahoma . 
he mentioned that this resolution has been posted on the web site for 3 days or 4 days . 
i should say to him that that is not a substitute for the committee process . 
that is why we have committees . 
secondly , i am glad that the gentleman believes that the bill needs no amendment , but there are 434 other members of this house that should have the opportunity to amend this bill , if they so desire .
