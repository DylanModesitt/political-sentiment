madam chairman , i rise in opposition to the garrett amendment . 
this amendment would take out of the bill a provision that i strongly support which raises the permissible loan limits for fannie mae and freddie mac up to the median home price in high cost areas such as new york city . 
this is a simple and common-sense amendment which recognizes that home prices in some parts of the country are higher than in most of the nation . 
in these areas middle class families can not use lower rate gse loans to buy a median price home , because the price will exceed the nationwide gse limit . 
simple fairness requires that we solve this problem and give middle class families in these areas the same opportunity to use a lower-cost gse loan as those in other areas enjoy . 
this is about whether new york 's policemen , firefighters , school teachers , government workers and other middle-class workers can aspire to home ownership . 
i strongly supported raising the loan limit in high cost areas and i strongly oppose taking this provision out . 
this amendment is critical to new york and other high cost areas . 
but it does not come at a cost to other areas . 
this is not a zero sum situation . 
so i urge my colleagues from these areas that are not affected by this amendment to join me in voting against it so that middle class workers across this nation will have a chance at the american dream of owning your own home .
