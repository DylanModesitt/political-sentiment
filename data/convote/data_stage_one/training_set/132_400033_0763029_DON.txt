mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman from texas ' ( mr. hall ) xz4001650 willingness to accept the amendment . 
what he said is true : there are over 100 million bicycles in this country . 
we have seen in community after community when there have been opportunities people bike . 
in my home town of portland , oregon , we have tripled the number of people who are commuting by bicycle . 
and when you take thousands of people off the road , it makes a difference in air quality . 
it makes a difference in congestion , and it makes a difference in terms of people 's health . 
this is a small step in the right direction . 
i urge its adoption , and i look forward to greater application in the future . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
