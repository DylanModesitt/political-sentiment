mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the boehlert-markey amendment . 
despite the bill 's claims to meet our nation 's energy needs and provide for our nation 's future , h.r. 6 ignores a pivotal approach that will reduce our foreign dependence on oil and alleviate our high oil consumption , increasing fuel economy standards . 
let us look at what we know . 
we know that fuel economy standards have helped to reduce our dependence on foreign oil . 
we know that raising the standard to 33 miles a gallon over the next 10 years , which this amendment would do , would save 10 percent of the gas we will consume , and we know that we have the potential in this country to make cars and light trucks much more efficiently . 
mr. chairman , we need to unlock that potential . 
we have the technology ; we have the innovation . 
despite all of this , the bill before us makes no effort to increase those standards . 
we have a choice : do we want an energy future that is stagnant and dependent on traditional sources , or do we want a future that will break new boundaries in innovation and technology , reduce our dependency on foreign oil , increase conservation and efficiency and ensure the security of our nation ? 
let us prove that we are serious about our nation 's energy future . 
increasing fuel economy standards should be part of the solution and part of our national energy policy . 
and i urge my colleagues to vote for the boehlert-markey amendment .
