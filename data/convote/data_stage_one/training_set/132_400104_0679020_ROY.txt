i appreciate the gentleman yielding . 
i do recall that in the last congress when we approached the energy bill there was i think at least 20 , if not more , amendments allowed on the bill . 
i would anticipate that the same approach , because the bill is very similar to the bill we passed in the last congress , would be taken .
