mr. speaker , if the gentleman will yield , as i said in my remarks earlier today , the chairman of the appropriations committee , the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002401 , has done an absolutely phenomenonal job in moving these measures through . 
as you know , we have just voted on the foreign operations appropriations bill conference report , and we have three conference groups that are continuing to meet on energy and water , the science , state , justice , and commerce appropriation bill , and the military quality of life appropriations conference report . 
from the conversation i have had with the chairman of the committee , it is his hope that we have those three measures up for consideration at some point next week .
