mr. chairman , the gentleman from new york 's ( mr. hinchey ) xz4001780 amendment just restates existing law . 
what ken tomlinson wants to do is turn npr into the nrc , the national republican committee , rather than national public radio . 
that is what it is all about . 
cpb used to stand for corporation for public broadcasting . 
now it will stand for corporation for political boondoggles , as this republican administration seeks to politicize something that in all national polling is the most respected news outlet in the united states of america . 
this is wrong . 
support the hinchey amendment .
