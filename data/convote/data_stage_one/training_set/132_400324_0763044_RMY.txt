mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the davis-waxman amendment to h.r. 6 . 
mr. chairman , i could stand here all day and discuss some of the problems that are currently plaguing the department of energy , but as chairman of the subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization within the committee on government reform , i am growing more and more convinced the department of energy is not only experiencing problems relating to how to remove nuclear waste , but also other energy-related projects . 
now is not the time to be introducing two new assistant secretaries at the department of energy . 
i firmly believe that adding additional layers of bureaucracy to this department will only serve to cause more problems , rather than to solve problems . 
mr. chairman , when the committee on government reform and the subcommittee were considering the energy bill , i introduced an amendment to strip this position . 
my amendment was supported unanimously by the full committee . 
my colleagues recognized that with the current existence of a culture of mismanagement , now is not the time to create additional bureaucracy . 
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bipartisan amendment .
