mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from california for his leadership and also the gentlewoman from nevada . 
but i do want to take this time , mr. chairman , to recognize the extraordinary leadership of the gentleman from illinois ( chairman hyde ) of the committee on international relations . 
the gentleman from illinois is truly a man with a backbone of steel and a heart of gold . 
he is an icon of this institution ; and i , for one , know i am joined by every member of this house in thanking him for his leadership on this bill and the number of other measures that he has worked on and done such a tremendous job with . 
i am proud to be here in support of the henry j. hyde u.n . 
reform bill , and i know my colleagues join me in thanking the gentleman from illinois ( chairman hyde ) for all that he does . 
in paraphrasing a well-known phrase , i would like to just say , mr. chairman , i sleep better every night knowing that henry hyde is here fighting for america . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
