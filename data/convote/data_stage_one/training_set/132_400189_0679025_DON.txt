i certainly will , but let me make one additional point . 
every previous change that i know of , and you and i have been here about the same time . 
i have been here perhaps a couple of years longer than you . 
every change that i know of in the ethics rules have been affected by a bipartisan agreement until this one . 
there were only a few votes , i think we were almost unanimous on our side , which is not unusual , which is why the ethics rules has historically been separate and apart , perhaps in the rules package , but agreed to in a bipartisan fashion . 
and that is my concern .
