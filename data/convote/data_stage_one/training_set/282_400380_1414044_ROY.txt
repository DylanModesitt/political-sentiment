mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
on behalf of the majority we are also very happy to accept this amendment . 
this amendment seeks to identify overspending due to possibly rigged contracts at u.n . 
buildings around the world . 
the u.s. generally pays 22 percent of those costs . 
the savings could be in the millions of dollars for u.s. taxpayers if other instances of building improprieties were found and , by connection , action taken to correct those improprieties . 
mr. chairman , i want to congratulate the gentleman on his amendment , and we are accepting it again as well .
