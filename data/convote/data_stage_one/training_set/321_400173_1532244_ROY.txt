mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
my friend from california proves my point . 
he admits that in a government-to-government relationship , as the san manuel band has done already , they actually put together an agreement with greater union rights than the nlra . 
that is precisely the point . 
tribes should have the sovereign ability to decide that if they want to bring in those expansion of rights , yes . 
but it should be their decision . 
sovereignty is not situational , and any attempt to paint this otherwise is wrong . 
that is why the amendment should be passed . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
