madam speaker , i thank the gentlewoman for organizing this special order , and i ask the gentleman from idaho if he would pause a moment to engage in a brief colloquy with the gentleman from idaho ( mr. otter ) xz4003050 because the gentleman holds some expertise , and that is the need to continue to build refineries in this country , crude oil refineries . 
could you speak for a moment about what we expect will happen with refinery construction in this country if we pass the energy bill as it is presented .
