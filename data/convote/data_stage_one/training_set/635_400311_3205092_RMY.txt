mr. speaker , while h.r. 2830 , the pension protection act of 2005 , is not perfect , it does decrease the risk that employees will be deprived of pension benefits they were promised as part of their employment contracts . 
h.r. 2830 also decreases the likelihood that american taxpayers will be forced to bailout private pensions , and reduces the tax burden on american workers to provide them with greater incentives and opportunities to save for their own retirements . 
therefore , i will vote for this bill on final passage . 
however , i oppose this rule , because i do not like the process under which this bill is being brought to the floor . 
the rule before us today does not allow any member to offer , or vote on , amendments that may improve this bill . 
in particular , i was hoping to vote on an amendment protecting united airline retirees from having their pension benefits reduced or terminated even though united expects to make $ 1 billion in profit within 1 year of being discharged from bankruptcy .
