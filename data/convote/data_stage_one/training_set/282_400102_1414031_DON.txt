mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me . 
i do obviously support the acceptance by our ranking member of the amendment . 
i think it is important to note for the record that there are currently investigations that are ongoing , and for the information of my friend from new york , the secretary general has been very explicit that he will fully cooperate . 
we have received information back that that cooperation is , in fact , occurring , and he has publicly stated , without equivocation , that there will be no immunity for members of the united nations .
