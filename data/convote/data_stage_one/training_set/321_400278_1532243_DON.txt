mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
and first and foremost , we must understand that this amendment that is being offered has no impact on this process . 
these tribes will not know whether or not they are violating the law or not violating the law . 
this amendment does nothing for that . 
the law as is currently interpreted continues to go forward . 
what this amendment does is suggest that somehow that those workers on a reservation , working in a casino , who are not enrolled members of that tribe have no rights ; have no rights . 
in california they do , under a compromise that was worked out . 
last year we were working out a compromise for the first time ever . 
we had labor and the union and tribes sit down together . 
they left the room because this amendment was offered last year , and nobody has come back because this amendment continues to be dangled as somehow it is the answer to the concerns that they have . 
this amendment does not answer a single concern . 
it just kicks the can down the road , and people are still in limbo if they are seeking to work out an arrangement for those tribal lands and for labor relations on those tribal lands . 
that has not happened . 
we were engaged in those historic conversations when the gentleman offered this amendment last year . 
and nobody has come back to the table since then .
