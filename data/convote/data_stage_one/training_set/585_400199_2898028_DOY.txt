mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for his very wise amendment . 
he comes from a region that has suffered an enormous amount of border violence . 
but his local officials , in working with the gentleman , has brought this to the nation 's attention . 
this amendment will protect witnesses who i think are the crux of solving some of these heinous crimes . 
i have supported amendments such as this , which include language in legislation that i have which deals with rewarding informants in order to get them to tell the facts that would allow for busting drug cartels and others who are perpetrating violence . 
this is a wise amendment , and i am happy to support it .
