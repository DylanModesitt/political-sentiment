mr. chairman , as the gentleman knows , he and i have discussed on several occasions now my interest in funding the nci , national cancer institute , for more money to expedite finding a cure for cancer or finding that cancer becomes a manageable disease . 
twenty-five percent of the deaths in this country are caused by cancer . 
one out of every two men will get cancer . 
one out of every three women will be stricken with cancer . 
research is going forward at such a fast pace . 
i wanted to put together an amendment that would add $ 50 million for additional research centers designated by nci . 
i realize , picking up on what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 has just said , that this is a very tightly crafted bill ; but i would ask the gentleman as chairman , and this is coming from one who has suffered from lung cancer , that the gentleman find that money , or look for the money in the conference , so that we can increase the funding for nci so that we can expand those centers .
