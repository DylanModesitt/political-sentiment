mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i want to remind the house that it is already illegal to murder , rape , kidnap , cut off hands with machete attacks , conspiracy to do any of those acts . 
we lock people up for that . 
in fact , since we are talking about immigrants , one in 27 hispanic males 25 to 29 are in jail today already . 
those are crimes . 
they are doing the time . 
also , for those who are crossing state lines and all that , we have rico , continuing criminal enterprise . 
that is already the law . 
but this amendment just adds insult . 
and let us be clear : second-offense fist fight by a bunch of kids , under the bill , is 10 years mandatory minimum . 
this adds 5 years to the 10-year mandatory minimum for second-offense fist fighting . 
i think that is excessive . 
if the fist fight deserves more time , the sentencing commission can deal with that . 
i would hope that we would defeat the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary .
