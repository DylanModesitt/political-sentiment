mr. chairman , in conclusion , i will simply say to my friend , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 that this is not an amendment that justifies or does not justify the previous amendment . 
this is an effort to get the facts on what we already know . 
if you ride around at all , you do not have to go very far to determine what the problem is in this country . 
i ask all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to help protect this country from illegal immigrants . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
