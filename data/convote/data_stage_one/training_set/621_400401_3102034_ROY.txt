well , i guess we are going to be telling christmas stories . 
rather than fiction , i would rather deal with fact . 
yesterday 414 members of the house voted to assist a group who , on average , are far richer than those who receive dividends and cap gains . 
there were four no votes . 
all four of them were on the democratic side of the aisle . 
and i respect those people for casting what i believe was a sincere vote . 
but out of the 188 democrats who voted aye , i just have to point out that my friend who just finished speaking , who is on the ways and means committee , protesting the amount in this vote , voted aye . 
some of the other folks , just let me run down the list alphabetically , which tends to touch on lowey , lynch , maloney , markey , you heard him , & lt ; b & gt ; marshall , matheson , matsui , mccarthy , so as we listen to the rhetoric and the term `` millionaire '' is repeated over and over again by my friends on the other side of the aisle , it begins to be a question of whose millionaire are they talking about . 
if one is a millionaire in massachusetts , it seems , we want to protect them . 
if one is a millionaire in new york , we want to protect them . 
at some point the rhetoric , the fiction , has to be compared to the truth . 
the truth is 188 democrats , every democrat member of the ways and means committee , voted to assist people yesterday that are far richer on average than the individuals who receive dividends and cap gains . 
that is not a christmas story . 
that is the truth .
