mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i know that the argument on the other side is that we want people to take personal responsibility , but is it fair to say that there is personal responsibility when a company hides thousands of serious adverse effects , as was the case with a company that had a product with ephedra in it ; or when a company does not warn about its risks ; when companies know about dangers and do not market their product responsibly ? 
we are not talking about in this situation a food product that may be heavy in fat or may have cholesterol or whatever . 
people should expect in eating foods generally recognized as safe that if they abuse their eating habits they are responsible for it . 
but with a dietary supplement , if the manufacturer withholds this information about the risks , and there is no warning whatsoever when the manufacturer knows there should be , then it seems to me we are giving up the responsibility of the manufacturer to warn and taking people who are harmed not because they did not act responsibly and then saying to them they are out of luck . 
i would think this is not a good argument that we have heard on the other side , and i would hope members would make this exception . 
a food supplement , a dietary supplement in the form of a pill or some other process is like a drug , and i do not think we would want people to be subjected to no lawsuit that is legitimate if the drug has never been approved and never warned about by the manufacturer . 
so i ask support of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
