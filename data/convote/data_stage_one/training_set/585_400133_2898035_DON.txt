mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i thank chairman sensenbrenner and the rules committee for allowing this amendment to proceed . 
there is a very good section of the bill talking about grants for young witness assistance , and i think when we talk about that , as the bill does , very importantly , we also must explicitly talk about gangs because we know that youth witness intimidation generally comes at the hands of criminal gangs . 
so my amendment adds language to this section that provides for this bill to allow the use of witness protection grants by youths who are trying to leave a criminal gang or to prevent initial gang recruitment .
