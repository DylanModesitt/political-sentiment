mr. chairman , the base realignment process is designed to provide a more efficient and effective military structure . 
but , brac 2005 failed to meet these goals and that is why i will vote against implementing the recommendations of the department of defense and the base realignment commission . 
the base realignment recommendations fall short because they eliminate military resources and installations without producing meaningful cost-savings . 
and , the base realignment recommendations fall short because they call for the closure of naval air station joint reserve base willow grove , a military installation that plays a vital role in our nation 's security . 
mr. chairman , at a time when we are fighting a global war on terror and facing new and very real threats , the nation must be fully prepared . 
this brac round does not live up to the original goals of the process and , therefore , it should be rejected .
