mr. chairman , i just want to say i think this is about as dumb a thing as we can do . 
i think to take the money away from people who are doing the hard work , these are our people . 
these are people that are there because they care about our country and they care about freedom and they care about bringing hope and opportunity to the people of iraq . 
and the idea that we do not want to provide safe haven to them and the idea that we want to micromanage where this place is going to be is nonsense . 
we can not do that . 
we are asking people to go over there and bring hope and freedom and opportunity . 
these are americans . 
these are people that we sent there . 
and so we are saying to them that we do not want to give them safe haven ; we do not want to give them an opportunity to have a safe place to live and do their work , the work that we have asked them to do ? 
we need an embassy there . 
i can not think of a dumber thing that we could do as to take this money away and to try and micromanage the way that we are going to establish an embassy and an opportunity for people to live safely over there . 
those of you that have been there know what a dangerous place it is . 
these are the people that are doing the hard work . 
i would urge every member to vote against this amendment and to send a message to the americans that are over there , the people that are doing the hard work to bring democracy , we care about their safety , we care about the work they are doing . 
vote against the upton amendment and say to our friends over there , we care about your safety , we care about what you are doing , and we thank you for the tough , tough job you are doing in an area that is probably as dangerous as anywhere in the world . 
vote against the upton amendment .
