mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me . 
this is extremely well-crafted legislation that the chairman has brought forward in close cooperation with many of his colleagues on the committee on international relations , and i am in very strong support of this bill . 
there is language in section 4 which calls for a uniform code of conduct , which i think is a very excellent idea . 
we want to be very certain that as this legislation goes forward , it in no way can be misinterpreted to impinge upon the uniform code of military justice or the american servicemembers ' protection act . 
we are trying to avoid any confusion here and make sure that our men and women who are going to work in united nations peacekeeping operations and go around the world are in no way compromised .
