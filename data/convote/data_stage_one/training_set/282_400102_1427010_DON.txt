mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding , and i support him in his opposition . 
i point out that the nation of colombia , for whom we have provided billions of dollars in terms of dealing with the interdiction and eradication of drugs , would fall because they vote against us 90 percent of the time . 
i presume that most of that aid would be eliminated by this amendment . 
and i would also point out for those of you who support cafta that at least five of the countries i have been able to determine here vote against us , so that if we extend the logic of the gentleman 's argument , i would suggest that maybe during the course of that debate , when it comes to the floor , if it should come to the floor , that that should be a precondition to approval of the cafta trade agreement .
