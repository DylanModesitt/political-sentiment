mr. chairman , i wonder how many americans have bought a car and wondered why their gas mileage was not what had been advertised . 
well , it is because the fuel economy numbers advertised by automobile manufacturers are based on 30-year-old fuel economy tests , tests that have not been adjusted for today 's realities , and that leads americans to be regularly misled by inaccurate labels . 
the automobile industry has changed significantly over the last 3 decades , but the epa standards are stuck in the past , overestimating fuel economy data . 
i support this amendment . 
it will require the epa to update its testing standards so that consumers will have accurate fuel economy information in the future .
