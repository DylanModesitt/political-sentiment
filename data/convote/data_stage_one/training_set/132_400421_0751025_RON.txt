reclaiming my time , mr. speaker , i want to move the process forward . 
i want to get to the senate . 
but i want a bill that is good for america . 
and i want the president 's proposal . 
i want the 72 percent on renewables and energy efficiency and alternatives and clean fuels , extend the tax credit so people will drive these hybrid cars . 
this does not even extend that tax credit . 
it is not enough . 
we need to do more .
