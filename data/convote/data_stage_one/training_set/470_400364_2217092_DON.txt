mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
mr. chairman , the language in the bill is bad enough . 
this just makes it worse . 
we should eliminate the section of the bill where the bill already severely restricts the right of those convicted of sex offenses from their access to appeal . 
many who have been exonerated through dna or other evidence have been exonerated and released due to their access to habeas corpus petitions . 
restricting access to habeas will result in more innocent people being put to death or languishing in jail for crimes they did not commit . 
we have a serious question , mr. chairman , as to whether guilty people are entitled a fair trial . 
if you have a person who is not suggesting that they are actually innocent , but they just did not get a fair trial , they do not have access to habeas corpus anyway . 
an allegation of innocence is a prerequisite to getting into habeas corpus petitions anyway . 
this is just going to make it worse , and more innocent people will be in jail . 
i would hope we would not adopt the amendment to make it worse .
