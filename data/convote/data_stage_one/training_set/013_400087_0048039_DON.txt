mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i hope that this amendment would also be received as reasonable and with cogent arguments . 
my second amendment made in order under the rule would allow for the equitable distribution of these medals between the majority and the minority . 
since the 104th congress , 24 gold medal resolutions became law . 
using the process currently in place that has worked so well for us , the two parties in the house have evenly split sponsorship of these medals . 
republican members have sponsored 10 medals and democratic members have also sponsored 10 medals . 
in fact , this amendment probably makes more sense with republican support in it than democrats , as in the 108th congress , five congressional medals were awarded and four of those were sponsored by democrats , only one by a republican . 
but i offer this amendment out of basic fairness for both sides . 
i , therefore , believe if we are to limit the number of gold medals and if we are to obtain the bipartisanship that has characterized the process , my amendment should be passed by the chamber , my fear being that if we limit it to only four , then leadership will decide who will sponsor those four , and we in the minority may find ourselves on the short end of that stick . 
and that is why i offer this amendment . 
i hope that the members will agree to accept this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
