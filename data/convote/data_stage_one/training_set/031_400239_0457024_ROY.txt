mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i would take a moment to suggest to the gentleman that he may not be aware of it because he does not serve on those subcommittees , but there were at least six hearings in a variety of subcommittees and other meetings regarding this matter before we got organized . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
