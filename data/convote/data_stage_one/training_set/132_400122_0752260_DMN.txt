mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from new york for yielding me this time and i rise in strong support of the bishop-markey substitute . 
this amendment contains a number of provisions designed to reduce dependence on nonrenewable energy sources . 
it is ridiculous that h.r. 6 really offers no relief to the soaring prices of gasoline . 
i think that is what our constituents really want to see . 
the administration 's own energy information administration analyzed last year 's h.r. 6 and said , changes to production , consumption , imports and prices in it are negligible . 
it even found that gasoline prices under the bill would actually increase more than if a bill was not enacted . 
the bishop-markey amendment offers clear measures to lower the price of gas . 
we should not be filling the strategic petroleum reserve while oil prices are so high . 
we should urge opec to increase oil production . 
we should instruct the ftc to protect the american people from price gouging at the gas pump . 
these are reasonable steps . 
this is what this substitute does . 
and it will provide reasonable relief from high gas prices . 
i can not support h.r. 6 as it is written today despite my great affection for our chairman , who was more than fair when we had the markup in the committee on energy and commerce ; but this bishop-markey amendment would provide critical improvements to it . 
support this amendment today .
