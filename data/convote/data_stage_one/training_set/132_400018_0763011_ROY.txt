mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , with all due respect , this bill came out of my committee . 
i mean , read it . 
would i put something in there or approve something , or is there some secret language , some code word that the gentleman and i , either one , do not know ? 
`` no activities funded under this section may be carried out in the state of new mexico. '' boom . 
now , i am not saying the congressional research service did not tell the gentleman what he read in the record . 
the gentleman is an honest man , but this is the bill . 
i mean , the gentleman understands that . 
sure . 
mr. chairman , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from texas ( mr. hall ) xz4001650 , to close .
