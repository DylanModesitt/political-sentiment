madam chairman , i want to express my deep disappointment that the rules committee did not accept a bipartisan amendment authored by mr. stupak , myself , and other great lakes area members last night . 
this important amendment would have permanently banned oil and gas drilling in and under the great lakes . 
the current ban is set to expire in 2007 . 
i am proud to say that i have long been a proponent of banning oil and gas drilling on the great lakes and have voted to do so at every possible opportunity . 
the great lakes are home to the world 's largest supply of fresh water . 
in fact , the great lakes make up 95 percent of the united states ' fresh surface water . 
for those of us in the great lakes states , the great lakes represent a critical component of our environment , our economy and our identity . 
the risks drilling poses to the lakes are unacceptable . 
congress has a history in support of banning drilling on the great lakes . 
a ban was first approved in 2002 and has been extended twice since . 
however , the time has come to end the uncertainty surrounding drilling on the great lakes . 
a permanent ban should be put into place . 
while i am disappointed the rules committee has prevented the house from including a ban on drilling on the great lakes , i plan to work night and day with my colleagues to get a permanent ban approved -- either in conference or as a stand-alone piece of legislation . 
this is a fight i will not give up .
