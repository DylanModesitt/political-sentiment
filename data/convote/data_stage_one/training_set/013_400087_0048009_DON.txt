mr. chairman , an amendment was offered yesterday evening before the committee on rules that would have asked groups as well as individuals . 
we struck a portion of the language dealing with limiting this only to individuals . 
i would have asked , if that amendment had passed , would have enlarged the pool to groups as well . 
that was not passed in the committee on rules , and therefore we are here today working a bill that does not have that provision in it .
