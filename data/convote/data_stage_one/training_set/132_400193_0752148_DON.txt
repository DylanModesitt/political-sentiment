madam chairman , the gentleman from alaska ( mr. young ) xz4004401 asked a very important question : where are the technologies that we can use to avoid having to destroy the character of one of our most pristine areas in america ? 
and the answer is that we have technologies today that we simply stopped using 20 years ago . 
if you look at this graph , it shows the mileage of our cars that we have . 
you see , starting in 1975 it went up dramatically because we had a bipartisan consensus to demand to use existing technologies to improve our automobile efficiency . 
it went up dramatically , almost doubling , almost doubling by 1985 . 
and then what happened ? 
we fell off the wagon , and since that time , our average full economy shown by this middle line has absolutely , absolutely gone down since 1985 . 
the fact of the matter is , these are not future techno dreams that someone has dreamed up in their garage somewhere ; they are technologies that exist today . 
i drive a car that gets 44 miles to the gallon . 
i am 62 '' , 200 pounds ; it is totally safe and comfortable . 
we need to get back on the fuel efficiency wagon as we were in the 1980s on a bipartisan basis and not put a mustache on the mona lisa . 
you say 2 , 000 acres ? 
it is still a mustache on the mona lisa for our most pristine areas .
