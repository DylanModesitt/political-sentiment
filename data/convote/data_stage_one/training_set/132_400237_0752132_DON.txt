madam chairman , first , let me just say , i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 for yielding me the time , for his leadership and the gentlewoman from connecticut ( mrs. johnson ) xz4002051 for her leadership in making sure that this is a bipartisan amendment . 
opening up the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas drilling is not the answer to our long-term energy or security needs . 
the fact is , we are addicted to oil . 
the proponents of this bill would have you believe that the only way to cure an addict is to feed the addiction at whatever cost , regardless of the effect on the environment , on our wildlife , and on our public health . 
as a psychiatric social worker by profession , i can tell you this does not work . 
we should be working to reduce our dependency by promoting energy efficiency and energy conservation , and funding research to develop and utilize clean and renewable sources of energy . 
by allowing drilling in the arctic refuge , we are spoiling a pristine natural environment , we are furthering our dependence on oil , and we are contributing to high levels of asthma , such as in my own district in west oakland and throughout the country . 
reducing dependencies on alcohol and on drugs leads to individuals leading clean and sober lives . 
our country needs to reduce its dependency on oil , for a clean and sober and independent future is what our children deserve .
