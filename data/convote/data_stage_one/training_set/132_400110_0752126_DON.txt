madam chairman , if my colleagues want a replication of enron and the abuses , the stealing , the dishonesty that hurt pensioners , retirees , shareholders , others in the industry , hundreds and hundreds of ratepayers and hurt the structure of the states in the western united states , then vote against this amendment . 
this amendment stops self-dealing . 
this amendment requires that there be repayment of money wrongfully taken . 
it allows ferc and the sec to provide the necessary steps that will stop enrons and others like enron from doing what enron did , which caused such desperate hurt to millions of americans in the western united states . 
my amendment does go further than anything else being considered . 
enron 's abuses went further than anyone expected , far beyond , and they shook the entire electric industry . 
but it also hurt consumers , states , and also retirees and pensioners and shareholders . 
this amendment will stop that abuse . 
i urge my colleagues to vote for it .
