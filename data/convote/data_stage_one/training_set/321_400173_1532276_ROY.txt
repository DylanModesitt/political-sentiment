mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i will not take the full 5 minutes . 
i will simply say to both the majority and minority staff of the committee on appropriations and to members on this side , the gentleman from georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goode ) xz4001530 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. culberson ) xz4000890 , the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 , the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr. sullivan ) xz4003920 , who were all prepared to speak on this amendment , we thank them for their involvement . 
this revised amendment ensures that a proposed social security totalization amendment or agreement with mexico now fully subscribes to what has been signed into law , h.r. 743 , the social security protection act . 
and this ensures that any proposed totalization agreement would not have funds going to anyone from our neighbor to the south employed here illegally . 
i thank both sides for their cooperation on this , and though we may have sincere differences in the challenges of the day , i do appreciate everyone 's constructive attitude on this amendment . 
it shows the american people that , yes , we can get things done . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
