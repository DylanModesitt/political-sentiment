madam chairman , i am very empathetic to the concerns of the gentleman from california . 
we expect fully to address those concerns in regular order . 
therefore , i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi . 
the rule states in pertinent part : `` an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law. '' the amendment includes an emergency designation and as such constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule xxi . 
i ask for a ruling from the chair .
