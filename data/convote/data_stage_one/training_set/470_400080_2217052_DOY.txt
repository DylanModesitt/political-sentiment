mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his consideration . 
there are few needs as pressing as the importance of stopping the sexual abuse of children , and i appreciate the fact that we are providing special grant programs for prescription drug abuse , telemarketing fraud ; and now we can find a way to fund programs to protect the most vulnerable in our society , our children . 
i urge support of the amendment .
