mr. speaker , there are a couple of other items that are included , and one that i want to highlight is the 2-year extension on the reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends . 
it is so incredibly important for americans to understand and appreciation that if a member of congress votes no on this provision , it means that they do not want to extend that tax rate decrease on capital gains and dividends , which is so incredibly important and vital for small businesses , as the gentleman from texas talked about so eloquently .
