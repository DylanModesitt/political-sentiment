mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute . 
i would like to respond to my good friend , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. moran ) xz4002831 . 
first of all , i think the naacp and the civil rights groups will be eager to find out that his wisdom is superior to their experience in the civil rights movement . 
what the gentleman was suggesting may have been correct a number of years ago , but i would point out to the gentleman that the federal courts more recently have not been as desirable a forum for civil rights activities . 
the bank of boston case , that was 10 years ago and an anomaly . 
there are not other examples of class actions where class members lost money . 
no other court has made the same mistake . 
i would urge that neither the gentleman nor any of us rewrite class action rules because of one mistake . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr. inslee ) xz4001930 .
