mr. chairman , i yield myself the remaining time . 
i say this to my colleagues who are watching us on c-span : i think the debate illustrates the complexity of this issue . 
this is not the proper forum to adjudicate the problem of united or any other airline 's pension plan or the problems that confront pbgc . 
i would hope that the committee on education and the workforce that is dealing with the pension problems would address situations similar to this . 
this amendment has far-reaching consequences . 
that is illustrated by the fact that we heard a number of extraneous matters injected into this , including the schiavo case . 
i would urge members to vote against this because it is simply not the right forum to try to deal with a very difficult problem , and it will not be the last problem . 
other airlines are going to be faced with this ; and i think the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 is right , we need to take a look at this in the long term , but this is not the place to do it . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
