mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i am very disappointed that the gentleman from maryland referred to this as a closed rule , when in fact he knows it is not a closed rule . 
the gentleman from maryland understands that what we have done and undertaken in this rule is the opportunity that would allow any member , but in particular a member of the minority , a chance to vote on a manager 's amendment , a motion to recommit , and certainly final passage .
