mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment , recognizing the very serious problems that its proponent seeks to address . 
but it would be very unwise to cut the budget of the nea , especially after we succeeded in adding a little money back to it , because the nea is simply doing a fantastic job now of strengthening public arts education , of strengthening arts institutions , and of helping arts institutions to market themselves and strengthen the economies of not only our inner cities , but small , rural communities . 
so in connecticut , the nea , in conjunction with the connecticut commission on the arts , has really helped us develop the itineraries that we needed to attract tourism to the small towns with arts institutions or performing groups where the agricultural economy is failing . 
in our schools , the hot schools , ( the higher order of thinking schools ) , have been supported by the nea , and have helped children understand that not only thinking is a powerful process , but original thinking is an extraordinary process children can possess and use to grow in mind and spirit , as well as technical capability . 
in 139 of connecticut 's schools , they are using the nea 's shakespeare in american communities , a free educational kit that really helps kids grasp the power of shakespeare . 
who better can teach children about the horrendous power of greed to do evil and the tremendous opportunity of love to do good . 
so the arts are extremely important to the spiritual strength of this nation , the strength of its economy , and the health and well-being of our children , for the arts provide the power to aspire to new heights of greatness in each of us . 
so i must oppose this amendment , because it drains resources from the national endowment for the arts .
