mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the clarification offered by the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 . 
i would inquire of the author of the amendment , one question : in your research , did we determine that dhs , new as it is , is not doing that ? 
that is the first question . 
on the second , let me have the gentleman restate it again . 
because one of the concerns i have on the select committee on homeland security and watching , for example , tsa formulate itself and work to train certainly very professional employees , but the training does not necessarily lend itself to maybe the keenness of eye to see that false document . 
we obviously have to improve . 
i was concerned as to whether or not it is the spotting of someone , saying you have a false driver 's license , or can you restate that it is actually going through a judicial system with a conviction , determining that is what you ultimately did ?
