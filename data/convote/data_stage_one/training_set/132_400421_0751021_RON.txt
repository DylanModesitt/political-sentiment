mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me . 
i am torn , i will have to tell you . 
i support the president , and i support the president 's request for a national energy policy . 
but he sent a request for $ 6.7 billion of tax incentives , 72 percent of which was for renewables and energy efficiency ; and this base bill has 6 percent of the total for those two very important functions given the crisis that we face today . 
i am the cochairman of the renewable energy and energy efficiency caucus . 
over half of the house are members . 
we asked for four amendments last night to ratchet this back up some , just a little ; and all four were denied . 
that is not right . 
yet there are so many important things in this bill . 
so i am torn . 
i do not want to vote against the new residential personal 15 percent tax credit for photovoltaics that does not exist today , or the 20 percent tax credit for homeowners to install energy-efficiency improvements to their home , or charlie bass 's billion dollar rebate program for investment in renewable energy . 
but i am telling you , all of it together is 6 percent instead of 72 percent that our president asked us for . 
i am for the president . 
i am for his plan . 
and i hope that the conference report after we work with the senate has it all in there , because no one in this house wants an energy policy more than me . 
i have worked for a decade as an appropriator on those important investments , yet i asked for amendments to improve this bill , and every one of them was denied .
