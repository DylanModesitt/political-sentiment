mr. chairman , i stand today in opposition for raising the cafe standards . 
this is an irrelevant piece of legislation that is not only unnecessary , it is an outdated solution in search of a 21st century problem . 
changing technology and innovation have rendered this amendment unnecessary . 
the increasing use of hybrid vehicles shows that a market-based approach to increasing fuel efficiency is a better way to reduce american oil consumption than by placing arbitrary standards on automobiles that harm our domestic manufacturers . 
and , in fact , the only thing we get with cafe standards down in my district are car dealers with acres and acres of tiny cars they can not sell . 
with today 's high gas prices , hybrid vehicles will help reduce the amount of money that our constituents pay at the gas pump . 
mr. chairman , in the interest of full disclosure , i drive a hybrid vehicle . 
i did not buy it because of the tax break . 
i did not buy it because of any legislation that we passed in this congress . 
i bought it largely because of air quality concerns back in my district . 
but now i look positively brilliant that gasoline prices are so high . 
but the best thing about a hybrid vehicle , mr. chairman , is it allows you that feeling of moral superiority as you drive your car .
