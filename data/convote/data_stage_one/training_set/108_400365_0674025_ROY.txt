mr. speaker , i recall yesterday when the death tax repeal was on the floor . 
it was a similar rule , and the minority was offered a chance to offer a substitute . 
they offered a substitute which was voted on and debated in the house of representatives . 
but that rule passed by voice vote . 
so the rule under which we considered the death tax repeal yesterday is the same type of rule that we are considering today , except that the minority on this bill decided not to offer a constructive alternative substitute .
