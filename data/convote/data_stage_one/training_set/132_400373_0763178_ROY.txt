mr. chairman , i always enjoy following my colleague . 
he is very impassioned . 
he is just wrong on this . 
the picture that the gentleman put up , he wants it offshore and wants it piped in . 
one of the most crazy things ever to happen to me is i am sitting in my office and the energy company comes in . 
they are excited about building an lng facility in the bahamas and they want to pipe this natural gas in to florida . 
now , who gets the tax revenue from that facility ? 
not the united states . 
who will get the jobs from that facility ? 
not the united states . 
who is going to get energy security from that facility ? 
not the united states . 
who has a problem with a pipeline underneath the ocean ? 
we do . 
i just can not believe that we want to give up the jobs , the energy security , and the ability to have these facilities in the united states and put them in remote areas , many of them outside the continental united states . 
if we want good jobs , we want lower prices , we want to help our farmers with lower fertilizer deals , we have to defeat this amendment .
