madam speaker , it is rate that a man has a chance to known his heros . 
it is even rarer for a man to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with his heros as a fellow community leader . 
while serving as border patrol sector chief for the mcallen , texas sector , however , i had that chance . 
today , we are remembering the lives and groundgreaking achievements of the late judges reynaldo guerra garza and filemon vela and inscribing the u.s. courthouse in brownsville with their names . 
like me , judge garza came from a humble background , from a family whose parents were born in mexico and came to this country in search of opportunity for their children . 
he rose to preside over one of the highest courts in the land , in the process becoming the first mexican-american federal district judge and rendering some of the most important civil rights decisions in this country 's history . 
judge garza ended his career on the prestigious fifth circuit of the u.s. court of appeals . 
judge vela , much like judge garza , grew up of modest means in south texas . 
he is remembered as a hard-working and committed judge whose impact was felt not only in the courtroom , but in the community as well . 
perhaps the essential message for me to convey here , however , is that each of these men spent considerable time and effort emphasizing the incredible power of education . 
both judges garza and vela understood how education could transform the lives of young people , because they and their families had benefited greatly from it . 
madam speaker , i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation naming the courthouse in brownsville , texas after reynaldo g. garza and filemon b. vela -- two great judges , great role models , and great men .
