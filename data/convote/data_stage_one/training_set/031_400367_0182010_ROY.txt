mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
this amendment that i have comes as a result of my paying attention to not only the 9/11 commission , but also my service to the select committee on homeland security in the prior congress . 
it was very obvious to members of the committee , as we heard testimony , including from the immigration and naturalization service 's inspector general report from the department of justice where they recognized the deficiencies that they had , where a person who had gone through an entire process in front of a federal judge was ordered removed and yet only 13 percent of those were removed from the country . 
we have a problem . 
we have a problem that was enumerated in the 9/11 commission report . 
we are utilizing the techniques that are not only available in the law , but also that many courts utilize today , federal courts as well as city and state courts across the united states . 
we need to make sure that people who have gone through a hearing have been given the opportunity to make sure that they can present their case , but then have been ordered deported do so . 
the united states and , i think , members of this congress need to make sure that the things which we do , we give the tools to implement those necessary ways to enforce the laws of the united states to be done ; for those who have been ordered to be deported and have not done so , we are giving them a better tool kit . 
that is why the sessions amendment is being offered . 
i support this , and i hope the members will vote `` aye '' on the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
