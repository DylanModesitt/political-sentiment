mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i would like to compliment him on a very thoughtful amendment . 
i would hope , as this idea makes its way through conference , we can be constructive as the reutilization of unexpended ryan white care act funds will be a very great need to our various states . 
in 1988 , 1989 when the ryan white care act was initially authorized , texas was number 13 on the list of hiv-infected persons . 
we are still facing the devastation of hiv/aids , and we realize that the number one killer of african american women from 25 to 44 is hiv . 
in addition , we have seen it increasing in other populations , hispanics and asians . 
so for the sake of states that have not yet expended these dollars , this is a very important amendment . 
in particular , in my community , the donald watkins foundation , brentwood , st . 
john 's , montrose clinic , montrose counseling , and the st . 
thomas clinic would benefit from these dollars . 
but i hope we will find a way to work through with the gentleman , and i thank him very much for a very thoughtful amendment . 
we need these unexpended funds , and we need them now .
