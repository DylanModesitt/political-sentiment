if i could reclaim my time , the gentleman from michigan is a valued member of the committee and has several amendments that were accepted , that are in the bill . 
i hope he is at least in a quandary about maybe voting for the bill at some point in time , although he has not yet done so . 
but as he just pointed out on the underlying bill , we do encourage states , i think the language is , encourages the states to have such a ban , but we do not have the federal preemptive ban that the gentleman from michigan wanted . 
mr. chairman , in summary , i oppose this amendment . 
i think we have pointed out a number of flaws in it . 
i would hope at the appropriate time the body would vote it down . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
