mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
mr. chairman , i simply want to say that i rise in support of the gentleman 's amendment . 
i would fully grant that i think there is a problem with the timetable associated with the amendment because of its immediacy , but the fact is that under the rules of the house , the gentleman had no choice but to draw the amendment that way in order for it to be eligible to be offered as an amendment . 
the committee , if it so chooses , can easily fix this problem in conference . 
it can easily delay the effective date of the gentleman 's amendment , and i think that is what we ought to do . 
i think the social security administration , i think the federal government , i think the pentagon , i think our banks and other financial institutions , have been incredibly reckless in protecting the privacy of american citizens . 
and we are increasingly going to see this as a huge problem , and we are also going to see identity theft mount exponentially . 
i congratulate the gentleman for trying to do something about it . 
that is more than one can say for most of this congress . 
and if there are technical problems , this committee , if it is worth its salt , can easily have them fixed before the bill is reported back in conference . 
i urge support for the amendment .
