mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i just want to point out to my colleagues that are listening to this debate that the senior organizations want beneficiaries to have access to the new drug benefit . 
this is why the aarp , the seniors coalition , the national coalition for women with heart disease , the national kidney cancer association , the national association of manufacturers , the national chamber of commerce , and many others oppose this amendment . 
i would think that members would take that into consideration because these cover a broad spectrum of opinions on this and they universally agree that this is a bad amendment . 
for this reason i urge members to vote against it when we have the opportunity to do so . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
