mr. chairman , no person in our country should be given unfettered authority , unfettered discretion to waive any or all laws , for whatever the purpose . 
take this situation . 
in order to expedite construction of this fence , the department of homeland security could select a contractor without competitive bidding , use undocumented workers , violate child labor laws , pay the workers less than the minimum wage , exempt contractors from federal and state withholding ; workers could be forced to put in 18-hour-days without overtime pay , in unsafe conditions , and be transported in trucks used for hazardous cargo ; and allow the secretary discretion to have these workers construct fences and roads through private property . 
that is wrong . 
you can build a fence , but you do not have to violate all those laws .
