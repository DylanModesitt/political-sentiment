mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time ; and , in conclusion , i would just like to say that any national energy policy should be heavily invested in energy conservation . 
that is what this amendment attempts to do , with little cost to the taxpayer and to the government . 
i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. hall ) xz4001650 and the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 for the hard work they have done on this bill and for asking that the amendment be included . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
