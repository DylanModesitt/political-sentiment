mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
it is precisely what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 has been saying all night . 
we want the venue to be a federal district court in florida to look at this critical matter from beginning to end to determine what has been missed . 
there is a benefit of the doubt here that goes to terri . 
she ought to get it . 
we do not think she has gotten it . 
let the court decide .
