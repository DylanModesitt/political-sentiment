mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time , and i would say to the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 that tonight i will try to get more sleep , because i have spent so much more time dreaming , and perhaps tonight he will be in my dreams . 
and i will be dreaming that he wished that we would have had the amendment at 95 percent instead of the 50 percent . 
my colleagues , when you come down to the house floor to vote on the amendment , i want you to vote `` yes '' for the stearns amendment because in your heart of hearts , in fact in the heart of hearts of chairman hyde in my dream , he wanted 75 percent . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
