mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman yielding . 
i support the amendment as well , and i understand why federal officials who are designating the amendment would feel a need for this . 
as long as it is optional and as long as it requires training and certification , i think that this is an appropriate thing , to empower those federal officials designated who feel the need to carry a firearm to be able to do so .
