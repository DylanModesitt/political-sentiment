mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment because if passed , this measure will place extreme financial and legal hardships on border and urban hospitals . 
because this measure addresses emergency medical care , our hospitals and our doctors are bound by law and their medical oath to treat individuals who are in desperate need of medical attention . 
this measure cuts critical funding for our hospitals to cover emergency room care . 
due to the high degree of cost associated with this type of care , this amendment will leave hospitals with a choice of two evils , bankruptcy or closing their doors to these communities . 
either way , this measure results in a dramatic cut in access to health care facilities for all residents . 
this measure is irresponsible , impractical , and will destroy healthcare in american communities , especially in border states . 
therefore , i respectfully ask my colleagues to vote no on this amendment and yes to safeguarding access to health care in all cities .
