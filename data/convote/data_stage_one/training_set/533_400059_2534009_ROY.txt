mr. chairman , in closing , let me just say that we have consumer protection laws . 
this bill is not intended to expand those laws . 
it is not intended to put restaurants out of business . 
it is not intended to shift responsibility from individuals and from parents . 
it is about personal responsibility , and i urge opposition to this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
