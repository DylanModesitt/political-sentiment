mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i must admit that much of the opposition gloom-and-doom predictions are based on assumptions of what people and companies will choose to do and , therefore , the government should make those mandates . 
i am pleased that this particular piece of legislation is based on the assumption that people have the ability to make good choices for themselves without the assistance of the heavy hand of government . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr. sam johnson ) , the sponsor of this bill .
