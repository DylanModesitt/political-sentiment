mr. chairman , i would like to be heard on the point of order . 
mr. chairman , it is hard for me to believe that the rules of this house do not help ensure that the people we represent can trust their government . 
it is hard for me to believe that the rules of the house would mean that this house can busy itself telling other people how they should deal with end-of-life issues for dear ones , telling independent courts that they should not be quite so independent , and yet would not allow the supposedly greatest legislative body in the world to deal with a direct obligation of government , which is to ensure the public safety of the american people . 
this amendment would be in order if no member objects to it . 
the committee on rules , as i understand , when they passed out the rule from the committee on rules , they did not protect this amendment under the rule . 
that does not mean that it can not be considered by the house . 
the house can only avoid dealing with this issue if a member chooses to block the house from acting on it . 
mr. chairman , i would urge the gentleman from texas to withdraw his point of order so that we can vote on this most crucial issue . 
but if the gentleman does not withdraw his motion , then i would , reluctantly , as i am sure would the sponsor of the amendment , have to concede the point of order .
