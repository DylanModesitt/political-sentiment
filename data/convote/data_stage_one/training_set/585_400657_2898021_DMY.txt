mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , my amendment is an amendment that adds a category of preferential consideration for witness protection grants for jurisdictions that share an international border and face a threat from cross-border crime . 
basically , this would allow the border prosecutors an opportunity to protect the witness that sometimes fears that they might get a threat from international cross-border threats . 
i believe this amendment is acceptable to chairman sensenbrenner . 
mr. chairman , chairman sensenbrenner and ranking member conyers , congressman scott , thank you for this opportunity to offer my amendment to h.r. 1751 , the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005 . 
crime and violence along the us-mexico border presents unique challenges to the law enforcement community . 
border crimes can be especially difficult to prosecute : a witness to a crime along the border may be hesitant to testify if he or she fears it is related to criminal activity across the border in another country . 
the cuellar amendment is simple ; it adds a category of preferential consideration for witness protection grants for jurisdictions that share an international border and face a demonstrable threat from cross-border crime . 
this category will benefit such jurisdictions that choose to apply for witness protection grants . 
we must provide prosecutors every means possible to adjudicate crimes along the border , and giving them preferential consideration for witness protection grants will help that goal .
