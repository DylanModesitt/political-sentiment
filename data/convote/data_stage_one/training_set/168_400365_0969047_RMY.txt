mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i offer this manager 's amendment to correct and clarify several provisions of the legislation . 
let me briefly summarize the changes made by the amendment , as modified . 
first , the amendment would exclude property crimes from the crime of violence definition of the gang crime statute created by this legislation . 
the purpose of this change is to ensure that the gang crime statute is applied as intended to dismantle and disrupt violent gangs and to prevent unintended application of the statute for property crimes . 
second , the amendment would add conspiracies as a criminal violation and increase criminal penalties for any such violation under section 1952 of title 18 , interstate and foreign travel in aid of racketeering enterprises . 
third , the manager 's amendment would ensure that a portion of title 18 under existing law , which was inadvertently omitted from the introduced and reported versions of h.r. 1279 , is not changed as a result of enacting this legislation . 
fourth , the amendment would clarify the crime of violence definition under section 16 ( b ) of title 18 to include an act that by its nature creates a substantial risk that physical injury may result to a person or property of another . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
