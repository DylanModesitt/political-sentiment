mr. chairman , i rise in support of my friend 's amendment . 
when there is a decision being made to site a plant which , if there were an accident , could be catastrophic , i think that the people who make the decision whether to build the plant or not should be politically accountable to the people who live in the place where the plant is going to be sited , they should have visited the place where the plant is going to be sited , and they should have some clue as to what the locality is of where the plant will be sited . 
the issue is who gets to decide , a stranger or someone intimately familiar with the community . 
for all those who believe in home rule , vote `` yes '' on the castle amendment .
