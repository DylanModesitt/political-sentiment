mr. speaker , i have been flying wing on the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha ) xz4002860 for about 14 years , and he has always got me home safely . 
the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 and his wife are out at bethesda in the hospitals every single day taking care of our troops . 
there is no better team than the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 and the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha ) xz4002860 to make sure that our men and women are safe . 
i have another great friend in the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 . 
and if we were back in the times of troy , i would be achilles , and he would be hector , and we would cross swords , but we would respect each other . 
and there is one area , mr. obey , when you mentioned homeland security we can seat those swords . 
the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 is working on the abuses of the homeland security money . 
that is being taken on . 
i think we can work in a very bipartisan way to make sure that that happens . 
i would like to thank the chairman for the border issues , that we have been able to secure our borders with this bill and provide for border patrol . 
many of us have been working on this for years . 
and the speaker has granted us that at the first must-pass bill we can bring this forward .
