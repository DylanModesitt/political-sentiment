mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , the choice is simple , either you support the premises of sovereignty as reflected in article i , section 8 of the constitution or you equivocate or you try to give the national labor relations board preeminence over the constitution of the united states . 
i do not believe that sovereignty is situational . 
this is a mechanism where we can actually correct the wrong and put in place what had stood 30 years previously respecting sovereignty . 
vote for the amendment .
