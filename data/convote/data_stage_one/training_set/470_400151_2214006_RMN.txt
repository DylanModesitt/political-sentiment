mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume ; and , in closing , i would like to begin by saying that there are very few matters in our society that are as clear-cut as this one . 
child abduction and abuse is not a new problem . 
it did not begin yesterday , and it will not end tomorrow . 
this is a continuing struggle to protect our children ; and i truly believe that it will help protect my grandchildren , 7-year-old twins ali and hannah manning , 5-year-old hank manning , iv , and 10-month-old grey collins . 
the recent tragedies that have grabbed the attention and sympathy of the nation only serve as a grim and poignant reminder that our work is not done and we must continue to do everything that we can to stop the abuse and exploitation of our children . 
as i noted in my opening statement , this is commonsense , comprehensive legislation that attacks the problem in many different ways , from expanding the definition of sex offenders , to strengthening law enforcement 's tools , to increasing mandatory minimums for child abusers and kidnappers . 
additionally , i believe this legislation protects the constitutional rights of the accused while ensuring that the guilty see justice and the victims are protected . 
again , i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and the committee on the judiciary for putting this bill together . 
h.r. 3132 is sound , well-crafted legislation . 
i am confident that this legislation will empower the innocent over the guilty , victims over the predators . 
with its passage , our country , our children and our grandchildren , will be the winners . 
for that reason i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
the previous question was ordered . 
the resolution was agreed to . 
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .
