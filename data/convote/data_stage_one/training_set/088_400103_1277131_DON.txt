mr. chairman , i wish to speak on the point of order . 
mr. chairman , i want to echo my colleagues ' comments , because i think that we have an obligation . 
in my opening comments , i said that i believed that this bill is about what the house of representatives and members who are part of this effort have been asked to do , and we have been asked to protect the public interest on a whole variety of measures , and , in this case , we are talking about life and death .
