mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i support the attempt to block this sale . 
this sale involves a strategic asset and , more importantly , a strategic lever for communist china . 
our policy for the last many years has been to deter the chinese government in beijing from ever coming into the position where they thought they had enough leverage over the u.s. to cross the straits of taiwan . 
this would be a major lever that would accumulate to the chinese communist government on top of the sovereign class missile cruisers that they have acquired , on top of the mig fighter production that they have acquired , on top of the other acquisitions of major u.s. economic interests . 
i hope everyone votes against this , votes to block this important transfer of a strategic asset to , and make no mistake about it , the communist government , not a private entity , but the communist government of china .
