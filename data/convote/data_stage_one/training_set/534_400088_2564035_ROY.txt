mr. speaker , i hail from a state that respects the fundamental , individual right to own firearms granted to all americans by the second amendment . 
this right , so essential to our liberty , is under assault by legal teams bent on destroying the firearms industry . 
they have tried and failed to accomplish this in the people 's house and in state legislatures . 
now they are using our courts , filing lawsuits with no legal merit , yet still incurring tremendous legal expense . 
these lawsuits rest on the misguided notion that those in the firearm industry are liable for the criminal misuse of their products . 
this is a dangerous precedent . 
it makes as much sense as suing car manufacturers for damage , injury or death caused by car thieves or joy riders . 
it is important to every firearm owner in the state of wyoming that these lawsuits stop . 
if allowed to continue , firearms could become unavailable and unaffordable to the law-abiding citizen . 
the protection of lawful commerce in arms act will stop these lawsuits , while protecting causes of action based on negligence , defective product and other valid claims . 
i ask my colleagues to pass this legislation . 
by doing so , we stand up for the constitutional right of law-abiding americans to protect themselves , their homes , and their families .
