mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is absolutely right . 
we reported out a modified closed rule that provided the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 an opportunity to not only offer his substitute , but he could have offered a motion to recommit . 
so two bites at the apple . 
the exact same opportunity existed on this bill which has gone through congress after congress with an excess of 300 votes in the past . 
we said a substitute would have been made in order if it had been submitted to us in the committee on rules .
