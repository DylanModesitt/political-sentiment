mr. speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds , and i do so to simply focus on the issue that is constantly raised here , and that is , the notion that we somehow impose closed rules on every piece of legislation . 
there have been 113 rules considered on the house floor in the first session of the 109th congress . 
with the exception of those rules which by statute or simple resolutions or appropriation continuing resolutions , 10 percent of those 113 rules have been closed rules . 
we allow for a free floor in debate . 
more democratic amendments than republican amendments have been made in order . 
so we are enjoying democracy right here in the people 's house , and the people of iraq are enjoying the same . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
