mr. chairman , because of the rapid reading of the bill , the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 and i were both unable to offer our amendments and worked out an agreement to offer it at this time . 
the amendment that i would have offered would have helped restore funding for the gifted education program under the javitz program that funds programs in over 20 states and universities . 
it is this program that has helped out programs like the bronx project for creating urban excellence , serving 32 , 000 poor and minority students . 
not only did this program help the gifted students , for example , in that school district , but it improved math and science scores , a 20 percent improvement for the entire school , not just gifted students . 
the javitz program has supported programs in 125 state and local education districts since 1989 , reaching two million students nationwide . 
a complete list of the program is available from the department of education . 
i am very concerned that this program was zeroed out . 
in my attempt to earmark the program , other programs under this title would have been seen as a potential cut , and my colleagues from hawaii were very concerned about one program there . 
my concern now is that the program moves forward with zero for gifted education . 
and the attempted amendment was to correct that , because i do not think for the future of our country , for the future of science and math education that we should move forward with a zero appropriation for gifted education . 
but i yield to my chairman on this point .
