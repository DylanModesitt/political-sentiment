mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for that information . 
if i could raise one additional issue , it is my understanding that one of the reasons we have not appointed conferees and we have not gone to conference is the issue of the medicaid cuts . 
i understand a substantial number of members on your side have suggested that those cuts are not advisable . 
obviously , the senate did not include those cuts . 
can the majority leader tell me at this point in time if there has been any resolution of this issue , as to where we might stand on those medicaid cuts . 
i yield to my friend .
