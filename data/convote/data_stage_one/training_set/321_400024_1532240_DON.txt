mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to the hayworth amendment . 
tribal nations have established commercial gaming enterprises because of the economic boom it brings to their community . 
my hometown of las vegas looked to gaming many years ago , and now it has the one of the most vibrant economies in the country . 
one of the keys to las vegas ' success has been a strong relationship between labor and management . 
because of this relationship , workers have good-paying jobs and benefits and safe working conditions , and can take care of their families . 
we should give the workers at the tribal gaming facilities the same chance . 
last year the national labor relations board correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction over on-reservation commercial tribal enterprises such as casinos . 
make no mistake about it , indian gaming is a big business . 
and the people working in indian gaming on the reservations have the right and are entitled to the protections of the nlrb . 
i encourage the indian tribes and the tribal workers and the labor unions to work together to protect workers like they have done in las vegas . 
i urge my colleagues to vote against this ridiculous amendment .
