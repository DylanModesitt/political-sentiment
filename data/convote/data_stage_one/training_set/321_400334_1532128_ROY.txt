mr. chairman , i think the gentleman makes the point that this is legislation ; and , therefore , mr. chairman , i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill . 
therefore , it violates clause 2 of rule xxi . 
the rule states in pertinent part : `` an amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law . ''
