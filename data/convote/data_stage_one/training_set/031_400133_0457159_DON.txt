madam chairman , i know how reluctant the chairman is . 
this is a supplemental budget . 
by definition it goes beyond whatever we did in the previous year . 
that is why it is called a supplemental . 
and by some technical mumbo jumbo , he has managed to say that this supplemental is not subject to the rule that he just read . 
through technicalities , through arcane kinds of things , he is saying that the veterans of this nation are not entitled to this care because he is using a rule which is not being used for the $ 81 billion that we have on the floor but is used for this $ 3 billion that we are trying to use for our nation 's veterans . 
madam chairman , i understand these rules , and i understand these technical points of order . 
they are designed to protect certain amendments and not have others . 
fine . 
but when one uses that rule to shut out the veterans of this nation , to shut out the troops that are coming back from iraq and afghanistan , from the care that they deserve and will need , we are going to shut down ptsd programs , madam chairman , all across this nation , and yet every soldier and marine is going to come back with potentially that disorder . 
so one can use all the rules , but what we are doing here is immoral , it is unconscionable , it is outrageous that we would be treating the veterans in this way .
