mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute . 
the gentleman from wisconsin in an effort to find an inconsistency quoted me as being for habeas corpus so people can have their day in court . 
i am . 
i do not ever remember supporting a bill in congress where we decided person by person who got the right of habeas corpus and who did not . 
my argument is a separation-of-powers argument . 
yes , i believe a general right to go to court when you have claimed there has been an error in your criminal procedure makes sense , but we are not talking about that here . 
we are talking about , despite his claim that this is not a private bill , a private bill , a bill that names one individual and allows this individual to do it . 
so if the question is would i be in favor of this house deciding who got the right to bring habeas petitions mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from oregon ( mr. wu ) xz4004370 .
