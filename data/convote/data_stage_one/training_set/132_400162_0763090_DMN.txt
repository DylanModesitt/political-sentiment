mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
h.r. 6 guarantees an additional financial windfall , courtesy of the taxpayers , for oil and gas companies already reaping and sowing profits , record profits , and provides absolutely no guarantee of relief for the high price that consumers are paying for their gas and oil . 
i urge members to reject this approach and , instead , support my amendment which brings some semblance of fiscal responsibility to h.r. 6 . 
i find it ironic that the provision this amendment attempts to strike would stop the collection of royalties , yet throughout h.r. 6 , the $ 2.5 billion in subsidies that the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 pointed out , $ 2 billion of which go to the ultra-deep provision , is so strongly supported by the majority leader . 
i think it is time for the members of congress to say in terms of subsidies and handouts to rich , profitable companies , when is enough enough ? 
i urge a `` yes '' vote on this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
