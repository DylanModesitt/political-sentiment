mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i will close by saying just two things in points of clarification . 
one , the gentleman , despite the best efforts of this house , is incorrect . 
despite our amendment saying no money can go to saudi arabia , moneys were allocated to saudi arabia ; so they are now entitled to discount on purchasing for our military . 
so our will was not followed . 
secondly , to the previous speaker , this notion that they are not exporting wahabism has been debunked by the state department as recently as 1 1/2 months ago . 
they are exporting terrorism , exporting wahabism . 
i would say they are two-faced except they have so many members of the royal family , they are several hundred fahds , and the time has come for us to start judging people on what they do , not what they say . 
i have 5 additional seconds to make my punchline point . 
this amendment will say that we believe that saudi arabia should be treated not as an ally but as an enemy in the war on terror because that is what they have been .
