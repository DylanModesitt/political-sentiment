mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , first i would like to state my appreciation for the work done by the gentleman from ohio ( mr. regula ) xz4003340 , committee chairman , on this overall bill and his work and cooperation at all levels and the flexibility that he has demonstrated in the interests across this broad country . 
i bring before this congress an amendment that addresses an issue that americans understand , and it is an issue that i think congress needs to understand maybe more thoroughly than they do at this point . 
and that is that government has a role in promoting the general welfare in the united states , but we have gone past that role ; and now with our medicaid and medicare funding , we are opposed to be purchasing sexual impotence drugs with taxpayers ' dollars all across this country . 
we have been doing so since 1998 with regard to medicaid , and now cms is poised to do so also with medicare . 
that will be implemented in january , simply 6 months from now , and if we are not able to put a stop to this bureaucratic decision , then we will be down the slippery slope of millions of people who believe the entitlement is taxpayer-funded recreational sex drugs . 
so my amendment simply prohibits any use of any of the resources or funds provided in this act from being used for the administration or funding of viagra , levitra and cialis . 
it is that simple . 
it is something that i think we have a consensus on . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance my time .
