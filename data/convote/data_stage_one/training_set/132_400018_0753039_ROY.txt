mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute . 
mr. chairman , i wish i could find a way to say `` yes. '' unfortunately , i can not . 
i think the underlying bill which has an authorization to increase the crude strategic petroleum reserve and build it out to a billion barrels and also try to build some new refineries in this country , if we take those two things together , we will have the same effect as the gentlewoman 's intent , which is to create the ability , if we ever need the spr , to move the large amounts more quickly and to refine them more quickly and thus disrupt the american economy as little as possible . 
i continue to oppose the gentlewoman 's amendment . 
i urge a `` no '' vote . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
