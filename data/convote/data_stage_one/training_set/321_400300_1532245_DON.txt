mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
mr. chairman , i want to explain to the house why it is that i vigorously oppose this amendment . 
i am the only member of the chamber who was exposed to a recall effort because of my support for tribal sovereignty . 
even though the constitution of the united states does not provide for such a recall , our state constitution thought it did . 
and so i had to endure an effort in recall because of my fierce support for tribal sovereignty . 
but having said that , i want to say that the gentleman 's amendment goes far too far in that regard . 
now i will tell you why . 
in my state , we had an experience in which one of the tribes contracted out to a private party to run their casino . 
that private party took advantage of the fact that the compact that the governor set up with the tribe was defective . 
and under that defect , they made quite clear to female employees of the casino that it was their obligation , in blunt language , to either put out or get out . 
now , we all know what that means . 
and what the gentleman 's amendment means under those circumstances is that when you remove the protection of the national labor relations act , you subject individuals with no power at all to that kind of treatment by shysters and bums . 
now , as far as i am concerned , i heard a whole lot about family values from that side of the aisle . 
you think this amendment represents family values in that situation ? 
give me a break . 
it does not .
