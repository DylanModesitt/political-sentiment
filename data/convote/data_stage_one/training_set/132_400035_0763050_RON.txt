mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . 
just let me talk about the part that concerns me the most , which affects the director of the office of science . 
as i understand it , the concern about the bill is that it would create a new senate-confirmed position in the department , but the director of the office of science is already treated like an assistant secretary in all but name . 
he , or at points in the past she , is senate-confirmed . 
the office holder is paid at the same level as an assistant secretary . 
in fact , everything about the director slot is identical to being an assistant secretary except the name , and in protocol-driven washington and in capitals abroad , that can create confusion and be a problem . 
so i hope that when the senate comes back with this same provision , as i expect they will , we will be able to work it out based on the facts . 
all we are trying to do here is make sure the office of science , the leading funder of physical science research , has the stature it needs to do its job even better . 
this elevation will not create any more hierarchy at the department of energy , and it will not cost any additional money . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for his cooperation .
