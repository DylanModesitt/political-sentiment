reserving the right to object , mr. speaker , i think the members need to understand what is happening . 
as we indicated at the beginning of the debate , the gentleman from ohio and i were trying to work things out so that we could finish debate on this bill this afternoon . 
that , unfortunately , has not been possible . 
we have had quite a bit of cooperation from some members and quite a bit less from others . 
as a result , it appears that at this moment we still have 26 amendments to consider . 
as you know , there is an event which some members of the congress feel required to attend tonight , not the gentleman from ohio and not the gentleman from wisconsin , but because of that event , we are going to be required to begin voting very shortly . 
an offer was made to continue to debate mr. speaker , i want to say one other thing . 
i would ask members in the future if they are offering amendments to any appropriations bill to please be attentive enough to what is going on on the floor so that we do not pass their amendment in the reading of the bill . 
if we do that , then there are misunderstandings , somebody thinks somebody else was double-crossed or misled , and we wind up with frayed tempers . 
the committee can not be expected to take care of members who do not take care of their own interests . 
mr. speaker , i withdraw my reservation of objection .
