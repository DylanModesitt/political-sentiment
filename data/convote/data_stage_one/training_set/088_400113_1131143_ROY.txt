mr. chairman , i apologize to my good friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 , but i have always supported the oil and gas exploration . 
our economy demands it , and i believe this can be done safely . 
it is a jobs issue , it is about lowering the price of energy , and i strongly urge support for the peterson amendment .
