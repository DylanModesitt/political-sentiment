madam chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time . 
i want to respond very briefly to the chairman 's point . 
i have the greatest respect for my chairman as well . 
yes , it is true that the feinstein-hatch amendment that i offered in committee did not enjoy broad support on either side of the aisle . 
some on my side of the aisle thought the sentencing enhancements in this bipartisan legislation were too strong and could not support it . 
but the other amendment , madam chairman , that i offered that would simply reinstate all the preventive funding , all of the proactive funding in the bill , that was rejected by every republican member of the committee . 
not a single gop member of the committee on the judiciary would support the prevention funding in committee . 
and we do not have the ability to raise that issue on the house floor . 
it is my earnest hope , however , that in conference with the senate , which i hope will insist that we not only have a back-end strategy for dealing with the crime problem of gangs but that we have a front-end strategy as well and that we will have the chance to address this again in conference committee , and that funding will be restored .
