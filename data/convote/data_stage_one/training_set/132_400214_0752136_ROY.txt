madam chairman , i rise to support this amendment . 
since coming to congress , i have been committed to the need to maximize our domestic energy resources . 
however , i firmly believe that we must pursue domestic energy independence in a manner that protects our natural resources like the arctic national wildlife refuge . 
instead of opening up anwr to oil drilling , i believe that we should look to new sources and new technologies to increase our energy independence . 
i am proud to say that my state of minnesota is a leader in the field of renewable energy such as ethanol , biodiesel , and wind energy . 
minnesota companies offer innovative technologies to reduce our energy needs . 
these renewable energy sources and technologies offer a sensible alternative to help reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil without endangering our environment . 
that is why i support the markey-johnson amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same .
