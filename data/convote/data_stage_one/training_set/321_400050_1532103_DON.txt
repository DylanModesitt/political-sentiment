mr. chairman , i watched this , and i understand how the roll call vote is going to come out . 
but i watched this with the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller 's ) amendment . 
it was the same issue . 
mr. chairman , there were 10 or 12 of us over here saying yes , and 3 or 4 or 5 over there saying no .
