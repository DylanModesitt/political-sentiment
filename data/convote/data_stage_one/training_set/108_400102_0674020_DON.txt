mr. speaker , the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is correct when he says 8 years . 
i dare say we could spend another 8 years , but given the quality of this bill , given the reality that it imposes no responsibility whatsoever on the credit card industry , naturally we will be opposed . 
responsibility . 
we hear personal responsibility . 
what about corporate responsibility ? 
responsibility is a two-way street . 
to get a fair and balanced bill , we need amendments . 
we need amendments like the one that the gentleman from north carolina and myself filed which would have limited the interest on credit cards to 75 percent . 
sure , that might have shifted , if you will , some of us to support the bill . 
but , no , the credit card industry bought and paid for this legislation . 
somewhere north of $ 40 million was part of that effort . 
let us not kid ourselves . 
this bill was written for and by the credit card industry . 
it has nothing to do with the consumer . 
but that is why we needed amendments , to make it fair and to make it balanced . 
let us not just use those words .
