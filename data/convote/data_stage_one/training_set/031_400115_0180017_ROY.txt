mr. speaker , let me say , there was a lot of discussion as to whether or not we were going to make the nadler amendment in order , as my friend knows . 
i know that that addresses the issue of asylum . 
we are going to have an opportunity for debate on that and an up-or-down vote on that issue . 
we clearly had to deal with a wide range of questions as we fashioned this rule . 
i will tell the gentleman that i am very proud of the fact that we were able to incorporate many of the ideas that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle offered . 
i will tell the gentleman there were 10 amendments submitted by members of the minority , and six of those 10 amendments were , in fact , withdrawn . 
we made in order two of the four amendments that remained at the committee level . 
we had on our side 10 amendments that were submitted , and we have only made three of our amendments in order of the original 10 that were submitted . 
that is why i am arguing that we have , in fact , really gone the extra mile to ensure that the rights of the minority are respected . 
i appreciate the gentleman yielding .
