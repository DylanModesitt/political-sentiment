mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i offer this manager 's amendment to clarify that offenders who attempt to murder or conspire to murder a federal judge , federal law enforcement officer , or a federally funded public safety officer are subject to a penalty of life imprisonment . 
if death results , the death penalty can be applied to offenders who are principals . 
in addition , the amendment adds indian tribes as eligible entities for court security grants in section 18 of the bill . 
finally , the amendment clarifies the language as to the coordination between the marshals service and the administrative office on security issues . 
i urge my colleagues to support the amendment to this important bill . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
