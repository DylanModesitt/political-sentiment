mr. chairman , this amendment establishes a diesel truck retrofit and fleet modernization program . 
it authorizes $ 200 million funding between 2006 and 2008 . 
this amendment is modeled after a very successful program which my colleagues and i initiated in 2001 through the gateway cities region . 
the gateway region is comprised of 27 cities throughout southern los angeles county , one of which has the highest pollution area in the state of california , that i and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. millender-mcdonald ) xz4002750 and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. linda t. snchez ) and other members represent . 
in 2000 , the gateway region was identified in a study as having some of the highest levels of toxic exposure caused by diesel emissions in that whole region . 
as you know , 80 percent of the goods received at the ports of long beach and los angeles are transported by trucks through our cities , and this traffic heavily impacts the region 's infrastructure , the quality of life , and the health of the area 's residents , particularly the young and vulnerable elderly . 
diesel engine emissions contain cancer-causing substances such as arsenic , benzene , et cetera , et cetera . 
i urge all of my colleagues to vote for the amendment . 
ms. millender-mcdonald . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i thank the support of the members for my amendment .
