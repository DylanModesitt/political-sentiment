i thank the gentleman for those comments and would make it clear to the house , mr. speaker , that of course one of the considerations is members are trying to get back . 
they have had 17 hours notice of reconvening and with the vote to occur at 12 , obviously , 9 o'clock will have been 14 hours , and the reason we did not want to go sooner is because there are members on either side of this question who would want to make their positions known . 
so that is the reason for our concern . 
so i appreciate the gentleman 's comment , and my expectation then is that we will go back in at 9. mr. speaker , i withdraw my reservation of objection under those representations . 
the speaker ? 
is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas ? 
there was no objection .
