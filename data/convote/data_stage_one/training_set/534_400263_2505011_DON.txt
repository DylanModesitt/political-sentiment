mr. speaker , the exception that he just cited would not cover the example that i just gave . 
the bottom line is that it was an employee who worked for kahr arms that stole these weapons and that sold them to criminals for drug money . 
as a result , a young man was killed . 
and it is our understanding , based on my conversations with members of the judiciary committee , that in fact this would not be covered . 
so having said that , i would urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on this bill .
