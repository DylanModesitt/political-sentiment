mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment , and i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
while i agree that our counties would wisely use increased pilt payments , i think that this bill provides the proper funding for pilt , considering the very tight allocation the subcommittee was given . 
like many of my colleagues who represent districts with large amounts of federal lands not part of the tax base , i understand the difficulties our communities face . 
that is why i have always strongly supported pilt . 
but i believe that the $ 3 million increase that pilt receives in this bill compared to 2005 should be defended , considering the many other programs facing cuts . 
in a healthier budget climate , i would gladly support funding pilt at an amount higher than the $ 230 million contained in this bill . 
unfortunately , we are facing a much bleaker budget reality . 
again , i urge a `` no '' vote on the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
