mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to express my appreciation to the chair for accepting the modification and my appreciation to the gentlewoman from ohio ( ms. kaptur ) xz4002110 , who i have worked with on this amendment that would double the number of department of energy clean city programs that could apply for a pilot program to invest in alternative fuel vehicles . 
by amending section 722 , the amendment would increase the number of project grants from 15 to 30 for state governments , local governments , and metropolitan transportation authorities . 
now , we are offering this amendment because we believe that farmers and our urban centers can work together to eliminate our dependency on oil . 
farmers grow biomass feedstocks that can be processed locally to supply nearby cities such as cleveland and toledo . 
mr. chairman , i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from toledo , ohio ( ms. kaptur ) xz4002110 , with whom i have had the privilege of working on this amendment .
