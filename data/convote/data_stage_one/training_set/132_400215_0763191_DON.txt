mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman yielding me time . 
mr. chairman , we had a speaker just a few moments ago who said that we were going to have to give up jobs , taxes and energy security if we had a pipeline that brought gas to florida from out of the country . 
i will tell my colleagues , in rhode island we would welcome the chance to have our gas piped in from some other country because the fact of the matter is , our state knows , as every other state that has an lng facility knows , that if we were to ever have that explode , it would decimate a 50-mile radius . 
we will take our lives over our jobs , over our taxes , over our security . 
let us support the castle amendment .
