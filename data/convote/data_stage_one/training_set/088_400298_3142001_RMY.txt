mr. speaker , i am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2006 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 . 
this report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the congressional budget act and section 401 of the conference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 ( h. con . 
res. 95 ) . 
this status report is current through december 5 , 2005 . 
the term `` current level '' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the president 's signature . 
the first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority , outlays , and revenues with the aggregate levels set forth by h. con . 
res. 95 . 
this comparison is needed to enforce section 311 ( a ) of the budget act , which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution 's aggregate levels . 
the table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2006 because those years are not considered for enforcement of spending aggregates . 
the second table compares , by authorizing committee , the current levels of budget authority and outlays for discretionary action with the `` section 302 ( a ) '' allocations made under h. con . 
res. 95 for fiscal year 2006 and fiscal years 2006 through 2010 . 
`` discretionary action '' refers to legislation enacted after the adoption of the budget resolution . 
this comparison is needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act , which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302 ( a ) discretionary action allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure . 
it is also needed to implement section 311 ( b ) , which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311 ( a ) . 
the third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2006 with the `` section 302 ( b ) '' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among appropriations subcommittees . 
the comparison is also needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act because the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302 ( b ) suballocation as well as the 302 ( a ) allocation . 
the fourth table gives the current level for 2007 of accounts identified for advance appropriations under section 401 of h. con . 
res. 95 . 
this list is needed to enforce section 401 of the budget resolution , which creates a point of order against appropriation bills or amendments thereto that contain advance appropriations that are : ( i ) not identified in the statement of managers or ( ii ) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution . 
budget authority : enactment of measures providing new budget authority for fy 2006 in excess of $ 13 , 759 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause fy 2006 budget authority to exceed the appropriate level set by h. con . 
res. 95 . 
outlays : enactment of measures providing new outlays for fy 2006 in excess of $ 5 , 485 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause fy 2006 outlays to exceed the appropriate level set by h. con . 
res. 95 . 
revenues : enactment of measures that would reduce revenue for fy 2006 in excess of $ 17 , 308 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause revenues to fall below the appropriate level set by h. con . 
res. 95 . 
enactment of measures resulting in revenue reduction for the period of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 in excess of $ 96 , 085 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause revenues to fall below the appropriate levels set by h. con .

dear mr . 
chairman : the enclosed report shows the effects of congressional action on the fiscal year 2006 budget and is current through december 5 , 2005 . 
this report is submitted under section 308 ( b ) and in aid of section 311 of the congressional budget act , as amended . 
the estimates of budget authority , outlays , and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of h. con . 
res. 95 , the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 .
