mr. speaker , so the public understands and our colleagues understand , what i indicated was that the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 , the ranking democrat on this committee , who has been here over a quarter of a century , wants to offer an amendment that was supported in the committee ; and he has been precluded from offering that amendment . 
to that extent , the republicans have undermined the free and fair debate on this floor . 
that was my point . 
and i believe i was absolutely correct .
