mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , let me quickly answer my good friend , the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) xz4002201 by saying 2 things . 
when ferdinand , the great horse champion , was sold for slaughter , he was marketed as `` eating an american champion. '' there is a distinction there . 
number two , i would ask how many zebras , how many cows do we know the names of ? 
we know the names of many horses , and the fact is horses are not raised in this nation for human consumption . 
mr. chairman , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from kentucky ( mr. whitfield ) xz4004310 .
