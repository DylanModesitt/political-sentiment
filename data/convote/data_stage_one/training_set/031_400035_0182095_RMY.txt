mr. chairman , today i rise to express my concern over a provision in h.r. 418 , the real id act of 2005 . 
section 102 of this act states that the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive , and shall waive , all laws necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads in the vicinity of the u.s. border in areas of high illegal entry . 
the provision also bars judicial review of any claim arising from the construction of barriers and roads at borders . 
i understand that this provision is intended to apply primarily to the fence along the border near san diego . 
the construction of that fence is critical to our national security and has been delayed for far too long and i think it is imperative that it be constructed as soon as possible . 
however , i believe the provision currently contained in this bill is far too sweeping . 
it should not be necessary to waive all laws and judicial review relating to the construction of roads and barriers along the border in order to complete the fence near san diego . 
i hope that as the bill moves forward we can find a solution that will lead to the swift construction of this fence without sweeping away important laws .
