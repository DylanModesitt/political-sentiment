madam chairman , i would like to briefly explain the amendment and the purpose of the amendment . 
first of all , the amendment cuts $ 40 million from the common computing environment account and increases the value-added market development grants by $ 40 million . 
the amendment also reduces the conservation operations account by $ 20 million , and it increases the watershed rehabilitation account by the same amount . 
i understand that members may have some concern with these transactions that we are involved with here , but the reason that we are doing this today is to accommodate some legitimate concerns raised by the authorizing committee about some of the mandatory limitations in this bill . 
i have worked closely with the gentleman from virginia ( chairman goodlatte ) over the years , and i intend to work with him closely in the future , especially as he prepares to write a new farm bill . 
while i would have preferred to keep the cce account funded at the highest level possible , i am confident that when we get to the conference with the senate that we will be able to restore funding to this account . 
so let us keep this funding moving forward , and i ask for members ' support on this amendment . 
it is my understanding that the minority has agreed to this amendment , so we hope to expedite debate .
