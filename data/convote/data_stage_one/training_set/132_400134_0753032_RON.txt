mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time . 
i just want to point out the cost of a can of 7-up or coke does cost more because we inflate the price of sugar . 
the cost of a candy bar , i believe , is four cents more than you would pay otherwise because of subsidized sugar prices . 
and the problem is what economists call concentrated benefits , diffuse costs . 
nobody is going to come here to washington to lobby against a subsidy that only costs them four cents ; but , boy , the sugar industry , which reaps millions and millions of dollars in benefits from subsidized sugar is surely going to come to washington , and that is why we are going to have this kind of amendment today .
