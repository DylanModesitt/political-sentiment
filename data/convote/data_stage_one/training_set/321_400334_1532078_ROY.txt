mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i would just point out to the members that this is a very delicately balanced arrangement and i think the risk to all of this is that if we were to adopt this amendment , the benefits that now are available to retirees under pbgc could even be lost , plus a lot of jobs could be lost . 
and we are inserting ourselves or would be inserting ourselves into something that has been worked out among all the parties in a way that is in the best interest of both active employees and retirees , and this is not the appropriate forum to deal with this subject . 
we have legislation moving through the committee on education and the workforce dealing with pensions , and this would set a precedent , i think , for our body , the u.s. house , to interject itself in something that should be handled by the parties , and i think what they are trying to do is to work it out in a way that is in the best interest of both the active employees and retirees . 
for this reason we object to the amendment , and this is not the proper forum to bring this kind of an amendment or to make a decision with the consequences that this would have . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
