mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
the international atomic energy agency is a vital u.n.-affiliated agency that directly serves the national security interests of the united states and underpins the global nuclear nonproliferation regime . 
the iaea safeguards and inspection system is the primary means , and sometimes the only means , by which we and the rest of the world can gain information and insight into the nuclear activities of countries of concern such as iran . 
i want to take this opportunity to commend the iaea 's investigation into iran 's deceit , obfuscation and outright lies about its nuclear activities . 
for over 2 years now , iaea investigators have refused to be intimidated by iran 's crude threats and tactics , and they keep confronting tehran with facts and inconsistencies in iran 's feeble excuses and fabrications about its nuclear activities . 
even today , mr. chairman , an iaea official is reporting that iran has admitted , when confronted by iaea investigators , to conducting plutonium processing experiments far more recently than it previously claimed and lying about when it obtained uranium centrifuge enrichment equipment . 
mr. chairman , we must provide with all the financial and other support that we can , while pushing it , and its governing councils of member states , to give it more authority to investigate and even punish countries that have violated their safeguards agreements and their non-nuclear commitments . 
the provisions of the lantos-shays substitute amendment do just that . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
