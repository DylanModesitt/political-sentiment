madam speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
the principles that have just been enumerated apply to another provision that i would like to discuss , the mass action provision . 
under this provision , defendants will be able to remove mass actions to federal court under the same circumstances in which they will be able to remove class actions . 
however , a federal court would only exercise jurisdiction over these claims that meet the $ 75 , 000 minimum . 
in addition , a mass action can not be removed to federal court if it falls under one of the following four categories : number one , if all of the claims arise out of an event or occurrence that happened in the state where the action was filed and that resulted in injuries only in that state or in contiguous states ; number two , if it is the defendants who seek to have the claims joined for trial ; number three , if the claims are asserted on behalf of the general public pursuant to a state statute authorizing such an action ; and , number four , if the claims have been consolidated or coordinated for pretrial purposes only . 
i would appreciate the gentleman from wisconsin clarifying how the $ 75 , 000 amount in controversy minimum would apply to assessing whether federal jurisdiction exists over a mass action , and , most importantly , explaining the intent of the sponsors with regard to the first and third exceptions .
