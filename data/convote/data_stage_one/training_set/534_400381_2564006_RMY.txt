mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , for yielding me this time . 
mr. speaker , my home state of texas is well known for the number of residents who enjoy hunting and value their right to own a gun . 
today firearms are found in half of all texas households . 
a state law similar to s. 397 which protects the gun industry from frivolous lawsuits , in fact , is already in effect . 
texans , like most americans , use guns for recreation , hunting , and personal protection . 
unfortunately , there are some people who want to make gun manufacturers liable for what other others do with their firearms . 
our courts are already overloaded with frivolous lawsuits designed to topple industries that manufacture products a few individuals in our society have decided are not safe or appropriate for americans to have . 
it is the typical liberal mindset . 
they know better than other people what is best for them . 
if this bill does not pass , texans and other americans will be less able to protect themselves from burglars , rapists , and murderers . 
the department of justice estimates that 1.5 million americans every year defend themselves using a firearm . 
the constitution protects all americans ' right to bear arms . 
the second amendment states , `` the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. '' mr. speaker , to allow frivolous lawsuits to constrain the right of americans to lawfully use guns is both irresponsible and unconstitutional . 
i urge my colleagues to support this legislation .
