i enjoy it when the gentleman brings macadamia nuts into the committee ; we enjoy those a lot . 
but i would not propose that we make ethanol out of it . 
it simply makes no sense at all to try to turn sugar , or for that matter corn , into gasoline . 
additionally , those of us who oppose ethanol need to stand up today to oppose this amendment because what may seem like a small program now , once sugar states discover what corn states have discovered , it will become much , much bigger and spending will become more and more and more . 
10 million will become 20 and then 30 and then soon it is hundreds of millions of dollars . 
this comes at the detriment of taxpayers who will pay more at the pump . 
again , let me say that the purpose of this bill , the stated purpose , is during an energy crisis to bring down the cost of energy . 
and here we are employing programs that will simply make you pay , one , more at the pump , and , two , more in taxes because you are supporting this kind of subsidy . 
i thought it was kind of strange , when i was a kid the worse prank you could play , it was hardly a prank , it was property damage , but was to put sugar in someone 's tank . 
that was the worst thing you could do . 
and here you are going to ask the taxpayers to pay for it . 
it just seems wrong to me . 
with all deference to my good friend from hawaii , i just do not think that i can support this amendment . 
i am under no illusion , given the committee 's support , the republican 's support for the amendment that i can beat it . 
but someone needs to stand up and say what this really is . 
it is another taxpayer subsidy that is going to raise the cost of energy . 
for that reason i oppose it . 
let us keep sugar out of your gas tank . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
