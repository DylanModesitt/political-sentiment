mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the concern of the ranking member of the committee on ways and means in regard to the alternative minimum tax . 
the gentleman will be delighted to learn that this budget makes accommodation for a further amt extension of relief so that middle-class americans are not impacted by that amt provision that originated in the committee on ways and means . 
the gentleman from new york will be further delighted to know that the budget process allows the flexibility and the discretion for that authorizing committee to make those changes rather than having the committee on the budget direct them for them . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , chairman of the committee on rules .
