mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the delauro amendment raises serious constitutional concerns under the due process clause because it effectively repudiates the government 's contract with wal-mart . 
the delauro amendment would cause the government to breach its contractual agreement with wal-mart . 
as a result of the government 's breach , wal-mart would be released from obligations under the agreement , including its obligation to implement numerous measures that go beyond what the law requires to prevent future child labor violations . 
for example , wal-mart would no longer be required to provide additional training to wal-mart managers regarding the requirements of the child labor laws , would no longer be able to discipline managers who fail to comply with the child labor laws , would no longer be required to post warning stickers on all equipment the secretary has designated as hazardous for the operation by minors , would no longer be able to perform quarterly self-audits of all of its stores for the duration of the agreement , and it would not stop wal-mart from receiving advance notice of most investigations . 
the 15 days is a common practice in this type of thing . 
i think whether you disagree or agree with the settlement that was made between the department of labor and wal-mart , let us not get into the business of second-guessing it and , in the process , create a lot of additional problems and , in fact , it would be detrimental to the employees in terms of what has been agreed to in the settlement of this issue . 
for this reason , i would oppose the amendment , and i hope my colleagues would do likewise if we do have a vote on this . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
