mr. speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
mr. speaker , this bill does not make a decision on whether or not the feeding tube should be reinserted . 
it does not make a final decision on the issues that are being decided in florida . 
what it does do is that it says that a federal court , a judge , will review the federal constitutional and legal rights that belong to terri schiavo , and that federal judge will make a decision on federal issues , and that is all the bill does . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 .
