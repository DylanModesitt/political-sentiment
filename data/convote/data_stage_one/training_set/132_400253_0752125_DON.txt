madam chairman , i yield myself 1 1/2 minutes . 
the provisions which are in the bill already are good . 
it is that they just do not go far enough to deal with this electricity crisis that we saw that went across the country . 
what the dingell amendment does is very simple . 
it creates an antifraud authority at the federal energy regulatory commission with tough , new criminal and civil penalties . 
it ensures , in other words , that they can get the real job done . 
it also provides real transparency on pricing and trading of electricity in this marketplace . 
it also prohibits self-dealing , interaffiliate dealing . 
all of the kinds of activities which were identified in the aftermath of the enron and the related scandals is prohibited ; and the authority is given to the ferc in order to make sure that they get the job done . 
this is the needed final piece to make sure we do not see a repetition of what happened at enron . 
vote `` aye '' on the dingell amendment . 
madam chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 .
