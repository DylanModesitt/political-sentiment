mr. chairman , this issue is one of whether or not you want the federal government to decide if you are on a coastline in the united states that an lng facility is coming to your district . 
if you want your governor , your mayors to have a role , some role , in deciding where an lng facility is located , which would have catastrophic consequences if there was an accident or terrorist attack , you vote `` aye '' on the castle amendment . 
if you just want the federal government to decide in the middle of your district where this most attractive of all terrorist targets will be located , then you vote `` no , '' but understand the consequences on the floor today .
