mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
my respect for the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is immense , and he has thrust all of these hearings and all that were in committee where 40 members of the committee on the judiciary had an opportunity to participate . 
what we are talking about is today , 35 members of the house of representatives , 35 amendments are not being permitted today . 
so i guess the 40-plus people are the ones who are representing the near 395 , 40-plus none for the american people . 
that would be what i would put on the table from the minority side . 
mr. speaker , i am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. matsui ) xz4006631 , our newcomer , who is making her first statement as a committee on rules member .
