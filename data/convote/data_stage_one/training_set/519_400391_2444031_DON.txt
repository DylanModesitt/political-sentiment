well , mr. speaker , if the gentleman will continue to yield , i guess we are going to have to look in the bill , because in the bill we also put in there factors to be considered excessively too much . 
if you go to the bottom of page 2 , bottom of page 3 , we put it in there . 
our bill says that in 90 days the ftc has to define it for us .
