mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i would ask to engage in a dialogue with one of the authors of the amendment , if they wish to do so . 
i am not being facetious about this . 
i want to let the gentleman from new york know right up front . 
i have spent the last 10 minutes actually trying to look at the amendment to try to get a sense of it . 
it appears to me that most of it is the dingell electricity substitute . 
would the gentleman from new york agree with that ?
