mr. chairman , i strongly support the sessions amendment . 
this amendment helps ensure that deportable aliens are actually removed from the united states . 
incredibly , only 13 percent of the illegal aliens arrested and ordered deported are actually removed from the country . 
illegal aliens trying to sneak across the borders realize that , even if they get caught , they likely will never be required to leave . 
of course , this only encourages illegal immigration . 
the sessions amendment helps correct this problem by giving the department of homeland security guidance on the use of delivery bonds . 
delivery bonds are already authorized under current law . 
this is nothing new . 
they require aliens to post a cash deposit and provide a written commitment they will appear in court . 
if the alien who posts bond violates any conditions of the bond , the bonding agent can take the alien into custody and surrender him to the department of homeland security . 
the sessions amendment improves the use of delivery bonds by setting up 10 turn-in centers around the country to help bonding agents turn over deportable aliens to the department of homeland security . 
it also sets up a system to encourage bonding agents to keep looking for deportable aliens and turn them into dhs when they are found . 
illegal aliens , who comprise over 20 percent of all federal prisoners today , are a serious problem in the united states and pose , obviously , a homeland security threat . 
we need to make sure that aliens who are deported by a court of law are in fact removed from the country . 
the sessions amendment helps make sure that happens .
