mr. speaker , i want to thank the distinguished gentleman from florida for yielding me time . 
mr. speaker , i want to point out one thing to the body : there is one thing in this bill , one thing , that scores as a cost by the congressional budget office . 
one thing . 
do you know what it is ? 
it is the markey amendment that we accepted in committee to increase the home heating oil reserve from 2 million barrels to 5 million barrels . 
we accepted it because the gentleman from massachusetts has a legitimate concern about the plight of people that need home heating oil in the northeast . 
we accepted his amendment to increase the reserve by 150 percent . 
that is the only thing in the bill before us that the cbo has scored . 
now , is that a giveaway to big oil ? 
is that some kind of a payoff to industry ? 
or is that a legitimate need of the american people that we put into the bill because the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 asked for it , legitimately so , and it made sense , and we put it in the bill ?
