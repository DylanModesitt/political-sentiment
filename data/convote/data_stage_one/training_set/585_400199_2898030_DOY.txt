mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to thank the ranking member and the chairman of the full committee and the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee to allow the amendment that i secured that has to do with providing courts the opportunity to establish a threat assessment database similar to that of u.s. marshals . 
this provides our courts hands-on immediate information in order to determine the threats that are waged against these particular courts . 
this simple amendment , rather than include the attorney , in essence , the change of this amendment would require the attorney general to work through the office of justice programs to make grants to the highest state courts in states participating in the threat assessment database program .
