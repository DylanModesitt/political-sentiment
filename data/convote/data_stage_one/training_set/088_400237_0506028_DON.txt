mr. chairman , i would like to thank again the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 and the gentleman from north carolina , chairman of our congressional black caucus , for their stellar leadership in spearheading this responsible budget . 
it should not be an alternative . 
this is the budget we should be voting on . 
the republican budget is fiscally reckless and morally irresponsible . 
the cbc budget , if we think about it , really is a faith-based budget . 
the cbc budget is not only fiscally responsible , but it is also morally responsible . 
the republican budget fails to live up to any standard of morality that speaks to the least of these . 
on the other hand , the congressional black caucus budget acknowledges that in order to have a strong america , we must have all americans who are not vulnerable . 
our people can not be desperate if , in fact , we want a strong america . 
the republican budget cuts housing , housing for the disabled by 50 percent . 
where is the morality in that ? 
that is turning our backs on the disabled . 
the cbc budget not only restores these cuts but adds $ 120 million for housing the disabled . 
the republican budget is an immoral budget , if one asks me . 
vote for the cbc budget because it is a faith-based budget that takes care of the least of these .
