mr. chairman , while there are many different grant programs in the department of justice providing resources for initiatives fighting violent or sexual assault , we have not found any that are directly and specifically at local law enforcement 's ability to protect children from sexual predators . 
this provision takes an important step to make sure that after offenders are prosecuted and released , they are registered and made publicly known . 
however , it does nothing to prevent the abuse from happening in the first place , nor does it help officers investigate and track down offenders after complaints . 
so this amendment would not only help fund local sheriff and police units , implementation and enforcement of the registration , but would provide funds to make sure that local units have the resources necessary to pursue child abusers , including additional staff , training of existing personnel , and computers and software necessary to investigate predators who find children over the internet .
