mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i thank the gentleman for the schedule . 
with reference to the real id bill , mr. leader , can you tell us at this point in time the type of rule that that will be considered under ; and , in particular , what amendments , not necessarily specific amendments , but whether amendments will be allowed , motions to recommit , and items of that nature .
