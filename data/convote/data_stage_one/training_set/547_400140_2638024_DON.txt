mr. chairman , i yield myself 15 seconds to say the gentleman from louisiana has phrased that conundrum for groups exactly correctly . 
i agree with the roman catholic church of the united states that they should not have to make that choice , and the episcopal church and the baptist . 
that is exactly what the catholic church says : we have been doing housing ; do not make us choose . 
mr. chairman , i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 .
