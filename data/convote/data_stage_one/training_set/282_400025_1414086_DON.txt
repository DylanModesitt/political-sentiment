mr. chairman , i would like to use this time , if i might , to ask the gentleman from minnesota a question . 
his amendment says that nothing in this title , this title that the gentleman from illinois ( chairman hyde ) has brought to us , should be construed to supersede the uniform code of military justice or surrender u.s. officials to a foreign country or international tribunal . 
could the gentleman tell the body what section of the gentleman from illinois ' ( chairman hyde ) bill could be construed to require the surrender of officials , what section of the gentleman from illinois ' ( chairman hyde ) bill could be construed as requiring superseding the uniform code of military justice ? 
i am certainly unaware of any such section , and i am certainly unaware of any desire by the gentleman from illinois ( chairman hyde ) to present to the body such a section .
