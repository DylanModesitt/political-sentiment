mr. chairman , while i am very empathetic to the gentleman 's concern , for i have many a grandchild myself , i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi . 
the rule states in pertinent part : `` an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law. '' in this case , the amendment addresses funds in other acts , and so i have to reluctantly ask the chair to rule .
