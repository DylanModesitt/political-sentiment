mr. speaker , i yield myself the remaining time , and i will close for our side . 
mr. speaker , first of all , let me remind the members of this house , the chairman of the rules committee talked about how generous the rules committee is . 
this year , in the 109th congress , we have had 43 restrictive rules , 22 closed rules , plus three additional closed rules that were included in one rule , h. res. 351 , and we have had 11 open rules as far as appropriations bills . 
let me also simply say my point was that on important matters we usually have closed rules , as we did yesterday on the pension bill . 
mr. speaker , i will be asking for a `` no '' vote on the previous question so i could amend the rule and allow the house to consider house resolution 613 instead of house resolution 612 . 
house resolution 613 was introduced last evening by international relations ranking member lantos , the democratic leader pelosi , democratic whip steny hoyer and the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 , which expresses congratulations to the people of iraq on three national elections conducted in 2005 . 
this amendment was offered in the rules committee early this morning , but unfortunately , it was rejected . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment and the text of house resolution 613 immediately prior to the vote on the previous question .
