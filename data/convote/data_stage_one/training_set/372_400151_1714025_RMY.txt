mr. speaker , i thank my colleague from georgia for yielding me this time , and i am here in support not only of h.r. 742 but of all four of these osha reform bills . 
what we are talking about here , my colleagues , is leveling the playing field , that is all , reforming a 34-year-old act that is long overdue for reform . 
during the 2004 elections , what we heard constantly from the other side was the concern about outsourcing of jobs , of losing jobs in this country . 
well , there is no way we can compete with other countries with these burdensome rules and regulations like osha puts on our small businessmen and -women in this country who create most of the jobs . 
we just need a level playing field , and i am proud to stand in support of these four bills , and i am proud of my colleague from georgia ( mr. norwood ) xz4002960 . 
nobody is more concerned about workers and workers ' health . 
he has been a leader all these years in regard to issues like the patients ' bill of rights . 
he has shown great compassion , and i commend him for bringing these bills , and for the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , the chairman , and the committee for working through this process . 
so as my colleagues have said before me , it is time to make these reforms and level the playing field . 
yes , protect our workers , but also protect our small employers so they can continue to create these jobs and compete in the world market . 
then , and only then , will we end the outsourcing of jobs .
