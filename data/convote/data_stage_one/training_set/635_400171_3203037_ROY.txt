mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , this debate has been on the rule to deal with a very important bill that has been talked about on both sides that needs to be addressed . 
i would just simply point out that there will be a motion to recommit , which has always been part of what the republican majority has suggested on every major piece of legislation since we have been in control . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
the previous question was ordered .
