mr. chairman , natural gas prices have risen by over 300 percent since 1998 . 
and while we are concerned about jobs going overseas , let us be reminded that we pay 25 percent more than china and 14 percent more than europe . 
we have lost some 3 million manufacturing jobs in this nation related to higher natural gas prices since 1999 . 
in the last 5 years , 90 , 000 jobs from the chemical industry alone have been lost because of higher natural gas prices . 
we have doubled the price of fertilizer which increases the price for farmers which is passed on in higher food costs . 
homeowners have seen a 55 percent increase in natural gas prices in their home . 
this is the issue of the law of supply and demand . 
if we want to increase the supplies , if we want to lower the cost , if we want to save jobs in america that so many people talk about here all the time , we have to have more natural gas in this country , which means we should be opening up safe opportunities , allow states to monitor this , all of which is in the energy bill . 
i recommend my colleagues oppose this amendment so we can keep jobs and keep natural gas prices lower .
