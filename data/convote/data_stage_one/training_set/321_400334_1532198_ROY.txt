mr. chairman , i claim the time in opposition to the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself as much time as i may consume . 
mr chairman , i will not take much time . 
i think all of the members are familiar with this . 
it has been on the docket before . 
and the problem with this type of an amendment , it goes across the board , as the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 said . 
there are many great programs in this bill . 
and the way this amendment is crafted , it hits the good with the indifferent and with those that are maybe not so desirable . 
so i would oppose the amendment . 
i would hope my colleagues would agree in voting against this if it were brought up on a roll call vote . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
