mr. chairman , i thank the chairman for yielding . 
mr. chairman , i initially planned to offer an amendment today to increase the maximum pell grant award to $ 4 , 150 . 
by increasing pell grant funding by $ 211 million , that would be funding through an offset by cutting administrative expenses under this bill by 4.86 percent . 
mr. chairman , i would like to engage in a colloquy with chairman regula and chairman boehner regarding this amendment , and i would consider not offering this amendment if i can hear their comments regarding the possibility of ultimately seeking a maximum higher pell grant award through good-faith negotiations with the senate during the conference process .
