mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , technically , as the gentleman and i both know , we have seen a lot , the majority is always going to control ultimately what is going to happen on the floor . 
it will go through the committee and go to the floor . 
i still go back to a whole history . 
i have been here for 12 years . 
i have watched these medals . 
i have never seen a bit of politics in these medals . 
i just have not seen it . 
i do not think the limiting of the numbers is really going to alter that . 
i think a large part now is because you need all those signatures , you just can not do it in a partisan sense . 
so i do not think this amendment is necessary . 
i think it brings in an element of politics that frankly we just do not have in the legislation . 
so i will oppose it . 
i understand the gentleman 's arguments , but i would oppose the amendment .
