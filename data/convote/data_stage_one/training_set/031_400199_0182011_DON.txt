mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
first of all , let me also refer my colleagues to the 9/11 commission report . 
what it said is that there were certain systems that needed improving or were broken . 
they suggested no such solution that the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 has offered . 
we need to strengthen the department of homeland security to be able to do its job , but more importantly , we need to be able to build those detention beds , thousands , if we will , to be able to have those that might be dangerous placed in detention locations . 
this amendment does not solve that problem at all . 
the arresting and gathering up of those who might be deported , clearly with no place to go , makes a bigger and worse problem than we might have . 
i would ask my colleagues to consider this not well directed and ask them to vote `` no. '' mr. chairman , i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 .
