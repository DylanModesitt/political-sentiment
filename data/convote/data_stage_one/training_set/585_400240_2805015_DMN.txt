mr. speaker , i really want to thank the gentleman for being patient . 
i understand that our financial services committee democrats stand ready to work on a bipartisan basis on this , and they have asked for a markup as soon as possible . 
since time is running out , i would like to ask my colleague why we could not simply take up h.r. 1153 , a bill that is a largely bipartisan product that the financial services committee reported last fall , but never acted upon .
