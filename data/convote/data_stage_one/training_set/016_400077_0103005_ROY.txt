mr. speaker , i yield to myself such time as i may consume . 
i would like to quickly address a couple of the concerns that my colleague raised . 
while i certainly respect his concerns , i would like to point out that the measure in question had been on our web site for 4 days and was not suddenly introduced yesterday . 
it had easy access . 
frankly , on the nature of the rule itself , it is the opinion of the majority of the committee this is simply an up or down matter . 
it is not something we need to amend or deal with . 
let me make one other point , if i may , mr. speaker , in reference to the access of the military to college campuses . 
the military is a rather unique institution , but nothing prohibits college campuses from denying them access . 
all the solomon amendment does is says , if they do , they lose some federal funds as a consequence . 
i would think that if they felt strongly , that this was a position of conviction , they would not want funds from the department of defense and other institutions . 
they would simply have nothing to do with them . 
further , i would simply like to make one additional point . 
the appropriate place to protest the policy , frankly , is in the political arena . 
this is not a policy in the department of defense per se . 
this is a policy devised by president clinton , has been ratified repeatedly by congress as a political avenue to address it . 
we should not put that burden on recruiters in the military and subject them to difficult circumstances when they are carrying out important work for our country . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from missouri ( mr. akin ) xz4000050 .
