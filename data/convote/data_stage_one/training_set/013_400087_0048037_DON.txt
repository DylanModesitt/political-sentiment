mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the sponsor made compelling arguments that the amendment is reasonable . 
therefore , one would conclude that if it is reasonable and compelling arguments are made that there would be bipartisan support for the amendment . 
unfortunately , that is not going to be the case . 
i hope that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , though , do recognize that not only are there compelling arguments , that they are reasonable and that it is a reasonable amendment and therefore deserves to be voted in favor of . 
and i hope that my colleagues on the other side as well as my side of the aisle view it the same way . 
mr. chairman i yield back the balance of my time .
