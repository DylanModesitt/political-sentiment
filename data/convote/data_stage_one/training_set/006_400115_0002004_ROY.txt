mr. speaker , let me respond by saying that the gentleman is absolutely right when he states that the chair does not rule on questions of constitutionality . 
i would also like to say that on this question that is being brought forward by my friend , it is very clear to me based on statements that have been made by a wide range of constitutional scholars that what we are doing in the rules package that we are about to consider is in fact constitutional . 
in fact , before the committee on rules the very distinguished former solicitor general walter dellinger said the following : `` it is simply inconceivable that a constitution established to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare would leave the nation unable to act in precisely the moment of greatest peril . 
no constitutional amendment is required to enact the proposed rule change because the constitution as drafted permits the congress to ensure the preservation of government. '' let me further , mr. speaker , say that the committee on rules intends to conduct further examination of the best way for the house to assure a continuity of government during a national emergency , and it is our hope that as we proceed with this work that further discussions will take place with the members of that very distinguished panel , the continuity commission , which included our former colleague , senator simpson , and speakers foley and gingrich and former minority leader bob michel , leon panetta , kwasi mfume , and i believe we will have a chance to proceed with this ; but i think it would be very appropriate for us to proceed with consideration of the rules package that we have .
