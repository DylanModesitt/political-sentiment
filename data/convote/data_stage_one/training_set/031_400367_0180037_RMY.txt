mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
this rule makes in order five amendments for members of both sides of the aisle , including one that i have submitted to ensure that aliens and terrorists are not in the united states illegally , and if they are , we are going to deport them . 
i think that this is a good bill , a good rule ; and i support h.r. 418 . 
we need to implement much-needed driver 's license reform . 
we need to close asylum loopholes . 
we need to defend our borders , and we are going to strengthen our deportation laws . 
and i encourage all of my colleagues to support the underlying legislation in this rule .
