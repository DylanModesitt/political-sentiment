mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , there is no privacy concern because no health information is shared . 
no personal health information can be disclosed to plan sponsors , period , and all plans are covered under the federal privacy rule , hipaa , that restricts the use and disclosure of personal health information . 
furthermore , plans are only allowed to use the contact information for marketing medicare prescription drug plans and facilitating beneficiary enrollment . 
they can not use the contact information for any other purpose . 
for all these reasons , i urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
