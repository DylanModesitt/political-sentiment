mr. chairman , could i ask a parliamentary inquiry . 
before we go to the gentleman from michigan , when it comes time to vote , are we going to vote on the rogers amendment to the johnson amendment , and then if it is amended , we will vote on the johnson amendment ; is that correct ? 
there will be two votes , rogers to amend johnson and then johnson , either amended or unamended , depending on how the rogers amendment fairs ?
