reclaiming my time , mr. leader , i thank you for taking the time . 
i know you did not have to , and you have been considerate of this discussion because you and i know it is an important discussion . 
because it is an important discussion , i would hope that we could move forward to try to get us off this impasse that we have for whatever reasons . 
and whatever is right or wrong , it needs to be resolved . 
there are two suggestions here of how to resolve it . 
there may be other ways to resolve it . 
but i would hope that in the coming days we could move towards , in a bipartisan fashion , move towards resolving this issue .
