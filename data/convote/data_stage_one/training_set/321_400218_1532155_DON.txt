mr. chairman , i yield myself the remainder of the time . 
and let me just conclude , that based on assurances that we received from the appropriate people on the committee on ways and means , the chair , the subcommittee chairwoman , and also the fact that we still have time in which to cut this rule off before it is fully implemented , it is my intent today to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and hope that we can get this resolved without further legislative action being taken . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment .
