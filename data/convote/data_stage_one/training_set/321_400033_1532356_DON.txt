mr. chairman , the fiscal year 2006 labor , health and human services , education , and related agencies appropriations bill is one of the most important bills for shaping our domestic priorities . 
unfortunately the bill before this congress imposes draconian cuts to the essential services that americans rely on everyday . 
the $ 1.2 billion cuts spread throughout these agencies will be devastating to the future of our nation . 
i am astonished to see that the department of education will see its smallest increase in a decade , which comes at a time when school districts across the nation are struggling to come up with adequate funding to address the unfunded mandates of president bush 's no child left behind . 
this is the wrong kind of message to be sending to our children and teachers . 
the one positive point during this debate was the passage of the amendment to restore the $ 100 million cut to the corporation for public broadcasting ( cpb ) . 
this vote signaled the bipartisan support that can be rallied to overrule the ideologically driven agenda of some in congress . 
millions of people across the country contacted congress this week in support of cpb and the overwhelming vote in favor of the amendment to restore funding ( 284-140 , 87 republican and every democrat in support ) is an indication of the more reasonable approach the country expects from congress . 
unfortunately , this bill eliminates 48 programs and slashes funding for critical programs across the country . 
i will not support a bill that falls so short in meeting america 's needs , in fact , creates more disparities . 
we must do better to address the obligations we have to the people of this country .
