mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for raising these concerns and agree with the gentleman that market transparency is an absolute need for an affordable energy supply and that the protection of proprietary data is a must for the efficient and effective use of u.s. futures markets . 
regulation of united states futures exchanges is certainly within the jurisdiction of the cftc . 
i give the gentleman my assurances i will work with him on language that reflects the commodity futures trading corporation 's jurisdiction in its vital role in market transparency .
