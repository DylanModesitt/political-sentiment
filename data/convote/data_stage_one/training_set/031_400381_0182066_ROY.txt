mr. chairman , i strongly oppose the nadler amendment , which would strip the asylum reforms from the `` real id act. '' the asylum provisions in the real id act are essential . 
the 9/11 commission specifically noted that `` a number of terrorists . 
. 
. 
abused the asylum system. '' just last year , a pakistani national who had applied for asylum was caught while planning to blow up a subway station during the republican convention in new york city . 
under a 9th circuit decision , a judge can determine that an asylum applicant is lying and still be required to grant the applicant admission . 
the doj inspector general reported that it was common for asylum applicants to make claims that they were falsely accused of being terrorists . 
in this situation , even if the judge believes that the applicant is lying and is a terrorist , the judge may still be required to approve the application . 
the real id act reverses this 9th circuit decision and makes it harder for terrorists to exploit our asylum system . 
it allows immigration judges -- like judges in most other courts -- to determine whether the asylum seeker is telling the truth . 
judges in ordinary criminal courts of law are routinely allowed to determine whether they believe a defendant is lying . 
yet , under current law , immigration judges can not make this common sense determination . 
the real id act is essential in stopping asylum abuse . 
this amendment would strike the asylum reform provisions and make it easier for suspected terrorists to receive asylum .
