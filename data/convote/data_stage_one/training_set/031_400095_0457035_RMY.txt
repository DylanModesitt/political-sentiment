mr. chairman , i rise today out of frustration with h.r. 1268 , the emergency supplemental wartime appropriations act . 
i support passage of this legislation , as i believe it is absolutely necessary to continue to fund the important activities of our brave men and women fighting the global war on terrorism . 
our men and women depend on having the necessary equipment and systems to be successful in mission accomplishment . 
as a member of the house armed services committee , i am actively involved in efforts , for example , to better protect our troops while they are in harm 's way . 
with that said , the inclusion of spending projects within this bill that certainly do not qualify as either `` emergency '' or `` wartime '' is outrageous . 
the issue at hand is not whether or not it is necessary to fund the noble efforts of our soldiers , for that answer is self-evident . 
rather , the question is about our responsibility to spend the american people 's money wisely , and in a manner consistent with the established process . 
i do not doubt that the non-wartime , and non-defense related projects in this bill are worthwhile ; however , the decision to fund these projects should be made during the established appropriations process . 
certainly , it is inappropriate for this body to have to consider legislation under the guise of emergency , wartime spending , when in fact , that description is not completely honest . 
again , i support this funding legislation as it pertains to the support of our military , and our efforts to protect american citizens , and to promote peace and democracy in the middle east . 
however , i do not support the inclusion of unrelated projects within this bill , and find it most unfortunate that members of congress are forced to vote on such legislation .
