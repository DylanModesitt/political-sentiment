mr. speaker , the gentleman from pennsylvania makes a good point , but if you look at today 's washington post , `` natural gas danger signs , '' they talk about a 90 percent increase in natural gas . 
higher costs threaten our economic growth in u.s. manufacturing . 
here is usa today : `` staying warm costs up 90 percent more. '' there is no way you are going to vote for the barton bill , the main bill , if you believe the price of natural gas is too high . 
if you believe everything the gentleman from pennsylvania said , you would vote against the barton bill , because it does not include natural gas . 
only the democratic substitute , the stupak-boucher bill does .
