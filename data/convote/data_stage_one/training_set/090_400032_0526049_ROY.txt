mr. speaker , we all know that there are deep emotions that are involved in this debate tonight . 
and earlier many of us met with terri schiavo 's brother , and i do not think that anyone can truly convey what that family is going through . 
and as a mother , a tragedy of this type is my worst nightmare . 
but , mr. speaker , we , this congress , we are not here simply because we believe in our hearts that a great mistake is about to be made . 
we are here because all of us , each and every one of us , americans , members of congress , we all know and we understand that the most basic , most fundamental right guaranteed by our constitution , that is the right to life . 
and it is our responsibility to protect that right . 
now , i interpret and a lot of people have looked at the decision by the florida judiciary and they interpret this as something that says our society , our country should be willing to accept and facilitate the murder of an adult human being , a human being who has not committed any crime at all whatsoever . 
i do not think the founders of our country or our constitution would agree with that decision , mr. speaker . 
i think it is entirely appropriate that the federal courts consider this matter , a matter that so clearly speaks to the core of our belief , the belief that every human being has worth , every human being has a value , and every human being has a right to live . 
our hearts are with terri schiavo and her family . 
our reason and our intellect are with the constitution .
