mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment by my colleague from delaware . 
this amendment takes a common sense approach in saying that those who want to board our nation 's airplanes must show documentation showing their full legal identity . 
the real id act , which i strongly support , requires that these driver 's licenses must meet tough federal standards , chief among them are the requirements that applicants must demonstrate their legal presence . 
as a member of the aviation subcommittee and as a member from the great state of texas , i strongly feel we need to put just as much of an emphasis on protecting the skies as we do our land borders . 
this amendment would simply require the homeland security department to better track those attempting to conceal their identities before boarding airplanes and allow those officials greater authority to screen these passengers and detect threats before they may occur . 
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill .
