mr. chairman , i am prepared to accept this amendment , but i think it needs a little bit of work on it . 
i am concerned about the drafting and application of the provision and am concerned about what might be construed as , quote , personally identifiable information of a person who is under age 18 . 
the amendment requires clarification of these issues , but i am willing to work with my colleague on this amendment to possibly modify or clarify the language at a conference later on . 
so i am prepared to accept the amendment and hope that it passes .
