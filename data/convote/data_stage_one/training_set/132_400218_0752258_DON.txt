mr. chairman , i thank my friend from new york for not only offering the amendment , but providing a very important point in this debate , and that is , unfortunately , the underlying bill is not going to work because it lacks one crucial element , and that is vision , the vision to see that we need to pivot off the status quo of the current energy policy and move to a new energy plan that makes sense for a new century . 
the fact of the matter is , and the dirty little secret in this place , those involved in energy policy have to admit it , is that no matter how many incentives we give to the oil companies , how many royalty relief provisions are loaded in this bill , even though the president who comes from the oil industry says that it is not necessary , given the high price of oil , is that we can not produce our way out of the energy challenge that we are facing in this century . 
we are already in a race against china and india for the limited oil supplies that exist throughout the world . 
this amendment provides the vision for us to start pivoting off from our dependence on fossil fuels generally , but the importation of oil more specifically , by providing incentives for alternative and renewable energy sources , incentives for increased energy efficiency and conservation practices and , hopefully , the incentive to move to a new energy source for a new century , and that is fuel cell development . 
i would encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment .
