mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
first of all , we had no hearings in the committee about this . 
i believe that on a subject of this importance , if we are going to take back this protection that we have had on the books almost for the last 25 years , we have to have hearings . 
we have to bring in the parties and give people good information about what this is all about . 
that was not done . 
this amendment came up for the first time in the full committee . 
so i believe just on process this amendment should be defeated , and i would tell the gentleman from pennsylvania that we should take a look at this . 
the committee should have some oversight hearings . 
but to come here now without having those hearings , the benefit of those hearings , and to present this and reverse 25 years of presidential and congressional cooperation would be a serious mistake . 
so i oppose the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
