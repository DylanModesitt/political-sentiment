mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from new jersey . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 again , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , and the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 for their support on these amendments . 
it is important that we have a bipartisan effort to send a message , whether it is to methamphetamine traffickers , pseudoephedrine , cocaine traffickers around the world , or heroin traffickers in afghan . 
the fact is we lose 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 americans every year to drug deaths . 
because they do not happen on the same day at the same place , it is not as dramatic as what happened on 9/11 , but they are still dead . 
i thank the leadership of the committee for their support on these important amendments so we can , in a bipartisan way , make a dent in this terrible scourge , drug use . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
