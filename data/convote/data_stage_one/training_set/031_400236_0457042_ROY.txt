mr. chairman , i move to strike the requisite number of words . 
out of deference to the chairman , i will be very brief , but i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 for raising this at this time ; and he has done a wonderful job in leading this effort . 
i would just like to stress the dual dimension of bipartisanship of this amendment . 
one , its legislative approach was introduced in the last congress , and with the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 i reintroduced it in this congress . 
secondly , as we think back to the truman commission , which the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 referenced , it is very impressive that that commission was established by the party in power at the time , and so it was the party in power that wanted to look at itself . 
thirdly , the truman commission was established at a time that senator truman was very concerned that a very small number of contracts were let to a very small number of companies in a very narrow part of the country . 
at the time , he was concerned about american manufacturing being held by too few in a contract sense . 
now we are looking at services where it looks like a very small number of companies have gotten very large contracts . 
it is more complicated today because , in addition , some contracts are going to foreign firms . 
so this is a very delicate area . 
i personally believe that the only way you can maintain a support for national policy , however controversial , is to have complete confidence that things are being pursued in the most honest way possible . 
i think the time has come for this type of approach . 
i would hope this congress would look at it .
