once again we are using the rules to block a commonsense amendment . 
it seems to me that the chairman has deeper issues than a blocking of the thing on a procedural ground and feels that the va is not doing its job . 
that is obviously a deep issue that we ought to discuss , but that should not lead him to block this amendment . 
in addition , the only way i could judge the sincerity of the majority party in these issues is to see what they had done to the chairman of the committee i have sat on for the last 12 years ; that is , the va committee . 
the chairman was removed from that job , purged from that job because he stood up for veterans . 
i hope , mr. chairman , that the gentleman will join me on a mission as i join him on a mission for accountability and efficiency to convince the leadership of his party to put back on that committee members of the committee who actually fight for veterans . 
once again , i think the veterans of this nation ought to understand that the rules of this house can be waived for anything that the majority party wants , but when it comes to the veterans of this nation , they refuse to waive the rules .
