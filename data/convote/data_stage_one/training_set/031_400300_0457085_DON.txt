with all due respect , the gentleman just misquoted . 
reclaiming my time , with all the due respect , the gentleman misquoted and mischaracterized my amendment in committee . 
the gentleman described it as an amendment limiting benefits when in fact it expanded them , and i do not appreciate that .
