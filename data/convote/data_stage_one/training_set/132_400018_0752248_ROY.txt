then right underneath that , we are talking about administration , penalties , enforcement and preemption on efficiency standard for appliances . 
after that paragraph i just read , then you go back and just out of the blue , it says , `` in determining whether to defer such acquisition , the secretary shall use market-based practices when deciding to acquire petroleum for the strategic petroleum reserve. '' again , i am going to assume that this was a cut-and-paste effort and something got left out and that should be in another place . 
am i correct or incorrect on that ?
