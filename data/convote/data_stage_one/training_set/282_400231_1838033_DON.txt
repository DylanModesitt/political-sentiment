madam chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i strongly urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this amendment . 
this amendment serves only to divide this house , which is ready to pass an important state department authorization bill practically on a unanimous basis . 
there is no earthly reason to have a divisive provision which we have debated and on which we have voted . 
i urge all of my colleagues on both sides to reject this amendment and move on with the bipartisan authorization measure .
