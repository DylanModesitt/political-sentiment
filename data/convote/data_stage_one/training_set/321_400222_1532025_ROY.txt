mr. chairman , given the fact that we are breaking this agreement , and given the fact that i am not able to offer my amendment , my normal course of action would be to object , but i hold the gentleman from new york in high regard , as the gentleman from iowa , and so i am not going to be partisan and i am not going to do tit for tat , and i am not going to object , even though objection has been heard from the other side . 
so i withdraw my point of order . 
mr. chairman , i withdraw my reservation of objection .
