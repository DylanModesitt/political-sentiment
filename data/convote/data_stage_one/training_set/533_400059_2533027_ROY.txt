mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the amendment was defeated last year on the floor by voice vote . 
it should be defeated again this year . 
this amendment would add to the list of qualified civil liability actions that can not be brought under the bill , civil actions brought by a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product or trade association against any person for obesity-related claims . 
whatever the rhetorical purpose the sponsor of this amendment seeks to accomplish , it should be defeated because it is badly drafted , and in the context of the bill , its application would be nonsensical . 
the bill only operates to prohibit lawsuits brought by people because they ate too much and got fat . 
the amendment would add corporations to the list of those who can not sue because they got fat . 
but whatever the intent of the amendment is , the fundamental problem is that corporations can not gain weight and suffer from obesity , which is the term used in the bill . 
a corporation , for example , can not eat too much and a trade association can not gain weight over the holidays . 
for all of these reasons this amendment should be defeated . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from texas ( mr. smith ) xz4003811 .
