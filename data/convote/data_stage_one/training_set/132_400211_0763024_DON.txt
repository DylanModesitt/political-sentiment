mr. chairman , it is definitely in texas . 
and we want to be able to use that fuel in a new way . 
so we thank the gentleman for allowing the amendment to be offered , i would hope that we would get favorable consideration by the committee or when we come to the floor for a vote . 
so we would urge consideration and support of the kaptur-kucinich amendment , which is future-oriented , budget-neutral , and helps move america to a new biofuel age .
