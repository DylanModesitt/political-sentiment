mr. speaker , i thank my friend from california for yielding me this time . 
i hear the phrase `` burdensome state mandates. '' a woman has a c section and gets to stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours . 
a woman has the right under a health insurance policy to get a mammogram paid for by the insurance company every year . 
a diabetic has the right to get insulin provided and other blood care paid for by their insurance company . 
these are the burdensome mandates that we hear talked about on the floor . 
one of my other friends talked about the heavy hand of government . 
that heavy hand of government in this case is evidently shared by republican governors around the country , because the national governors association opposes this bill . 
republican and democratic governors have looked at this bill and said laws that they have passed that many of our friends on the majority amendments that would have addressed these issues , that would have let us discuss these issues on this floor , were prohibited by the rule that we are debating right now . 
i would suspect that maybe one of the reasons they were prohibited is because republican attorneys general and republican governors around the country would have supported such amendments because they oppose the good work that is undone by this bill . 
members should oppose this rule and eventually , after debate , oppose the underlying bill .
