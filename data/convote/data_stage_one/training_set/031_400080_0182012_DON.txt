mr. chairman , i thank the manager on the democratic side for yielding me this time . 
mr. chairman , this amendment was brought to our attention yesterday evening , and at first blush , this is a shocking correlative point to be made and a comparison to the fugitive slave act of 1850 , in which agents were given the broad powers to return freed slaves in free states and return them back to slavery . 
what we are doing here with bail bondsmen is giving them the ability to enforce immigration laws by summarily rounding up and deporting people and also gaining access to incredible private and secret material in data files . 
and i just wanted to briefly ask the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 what inspired him to add this to a bill that we already had a considerable number of problems about and have never had any hearings on a provision such as this .
