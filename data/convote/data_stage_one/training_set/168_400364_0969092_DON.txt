mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i just want to remind the house that it is illegal to chop off fingers and you will be given more time than this bill will provide . 
murdering 28 people is also already illegal , whether this bill passes or not . 
but this amendment just adds insult to injury . 
if a child comes into the country because his parents snuck into the country to work , this bill , the underlying bill provides for a 10-year mandatory minimum for a fist -fight . 
this just adds 5 more years of insult . 
i would hope we defeat the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
