i would say to the gentleman , reclaiming my time , that the rules committee has been visited by the gentleman from massachusetts . 
he is no stranger to the rules committee . 
you also in your leadership capacities and otherwise as a member of congress representing your constituents from maryland have been very vigorous in your support of the things which you believe , the ideas which you choose to press to the rules committee . 
the rules committee is very open , and our esteemed chairman will make available that time . 
we do not know the content of that manager 's amendment that you are talking about at this time . 
we once again encourage all members , including the process that will be followed for the manager 's amendment , to be filed on that date , october 25 .
