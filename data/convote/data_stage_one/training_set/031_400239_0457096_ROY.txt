mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
i do so in order to have a very brief discussion with the gentleman who is chairman of the authorizing committee . 
i think many of you in the house know that i spent a lot of years in my life making an honest living in the life and health insurance business so i know a little bit about this subject . 
the gentleman is raising a number of questions that are very legitimate questions . 
i do not think there is a conflict here . 
i just wanted the gentleman to know that it is my intention to examine these serious questions between now and the time we go to conference . 
i am absolutely certain we can at least clear the air on any remaining problems between now and then .
