mr. chairman , i rise in favor of the farr amendment . 
this bill gives the secretary unprecedented authority to waive all laws to finish the construction of the security barrier . 
this bill denies due process to anyone challenging the secretary 's decision by prohibiting judicial review of the secretary 's waivers . 
these provisions would undermine the federal trust responsibility to indian nations by allowing waivers of federal requirements of providing tribal notification that are specifically designed to protect native american burial grounds , religious shrines , and cultural and historical sites . 
i urge my colleagues to support the farr amendment .
