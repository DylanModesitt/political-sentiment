mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this $ 82 billion `` emergency '' supplemental bill . 
i also am opposed to the manner in which the real id act , h.r. 418 , was attached to the rule , thereby stealthily making the establishment of a national id part of an `` emergency '' bill to which it is completely unrelated . 
once again we see controversial bills being hidden inside another bill so that they are automatically passed where they otherwise might face opposition . 
i do not believe this is a wise practice . 
this `` emergency '' supplemental is the second largest supplemental appropriations bill in united states history , second only to the one last year . 
the funds will be considered `` emergency '' funds so congress can ignore spending caps that would require the billions in new spending to be offset by reducing spending elsewhere . 
we are told that this is emergency spending , and that we therefore must not question this enormous expenditure . 
does an emergency require sending billions of american taxpayers ' dollars overseas as foreign aid an emergency ? 
this bill is filled with foreign aid spending . 
if we pass this ill-conceived legislation , we will spend $ 656 million for tsunami relief ; $ 94 million for darfur , sudan ; $ 150 million for food aid , most to liberia and sudan ; $ 580 million for `` peacekeeping '' overseas ; $ 582 million to build a new american embassy in iraq ; $ 76 million to build a new airport in kuwait ( one of the wealthiest countries on earth ) ; $ 257 million for counter drug efforts in afghanistan ; $ 372 million for health , reconstruction , and alternative development programs to help farmers stop raising poppy ; $ 200 million in economic aid for the palestinians ; $ 150 million for pakistan ( run by an unelected dictator ) ; $ 200 million for jordan ; $ 34 million for ukraine . 
does anyone really believe that all this foreign aid is `` emergency '' spending ? 
or is it just an opportunity for some off-budget spending ? 
just the above foreign aid equals almost $ 3.5 billion . 
does anyone believe that sending this much money abroad as international welfare is a good thing for our economy ? 
is there a baseball emergency ? 
there must be , because this `` emergency '' supplemental contains a provision to allow washington , d.c . 
to use taxpayer money to build a baseball stadium . 
mr. chairman , this bill is almost unimaginably expensive . 
it is our out-of-control spending that really is the greatest threat to the united states and our way of life . 
i urge my colleagues to reject this legislation .
