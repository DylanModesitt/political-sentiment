mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , as a physician , having practiced medicine for well over 30 years , let me tell members , there is a crisis in this country . 
there is a crisis with illegal drugs , but there is a crisis in this country with an overuse of all drugs , especially in the area of psychiatry . 
psychiatrists , if they are honest with you , will tell you that diagnoses are very subjective . 
it is not like diagnosing appendicitis . 
it is very , very subjective . 
if you push on this type of testing , the more testing you have , let me guarantee it , the more drugs you will have . 
sure , there are mental diseases . 
i am not excluding any of this when a person has true mental illness , but i am talking about the overuse of ritalin and prozac and many of these drugs that are pushed on these kids . 
let me tell members , there have been some real problems with families who will not let their kids go on drugs because the schools pressure them to . 
they have been charged with child abuse , and threatened with taking their children away because they will not be put on these drugs . 
that is the kind of abuse i am calling to members ' attention , and that is why you need to vote for this amendment . 
it does not change anything . 
it does not deny anybody testing and treatment . 
all it does is say universal testing of everybody of all ages in this country is not the direction that we want to go . 
please vote for my amendment .
