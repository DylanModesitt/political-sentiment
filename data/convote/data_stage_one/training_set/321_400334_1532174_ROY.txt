mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i understand what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 is saying , and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 will be a conferee , and it is something we probably need to discuss there . 
but in the meantime , there are 43 million people who are on medicare . 
we add 200 , 000 every month , and i would like to get more information from cms as to just what impact this would have in terms of cost and their ability to manage the system . 
the key to this is that we want the system managed as effectively as possible , and all of us as members hear from time to time from people who are not getting their medicare claims taken care of or they are having problems with medicare . 
so some system of keeping track of these and to identify them , we can imagine with 43 million people , it is not easy . 
so i would hope the gentleman would withdraw his amendment and i would work with the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 in conference to see if there is some way we can refine this language , and i would like to discuss it with the medicare people , with cms , to see what the impact would be or whether a workable system that would ensure privacy could be put in place . 
for that reason i would oppose the amendment if there is a vote on it .
