madam chairman , what we are debating here is what is affordable , how much is enough . 
middle-class families know the answer . 
if you are in the middle class , you are too rich to be eligible for federal programs , but too poor to be able to keep up with the cost of living . 
the language that the gentleman from california ( mr. gary g. miller ) xz4002770 , the gentleman from california ( mr. sherman ) xz4003710 , and i worked into this bill is a commonsense , bipartisan compromise that keeps up with that middle-class squeeze that makes the american dream of homeownership possible . 
with all due respect to the gentleman , this amendment makes the american dream of homeownership even harder . 
we should defeat this amendment .
