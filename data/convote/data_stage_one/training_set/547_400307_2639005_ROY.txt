madam chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
madam chairman , let me just say to my friend from pennsylvania there are some sections of that amendment that i support in terms of independence . 
but i do have a problem with the presidential appointees to the board . 
they are basically symbols of the tie between fannie mae , and freddie mac and the federal government , and really do speak to the implied guarantee out there for the gses . 
the gentleman indicated that he had bipartisan support . 
in fact , it failed on a tie vote in the committee . 
i will concede there was bipartisan support . 
there was also bipartisan opposition . 
but at the same time i think that president bush , who has decided not to fill those vacancies on the board , is on the right track , and i think this amendment would simply add to the perception of the federal guarantee . 
to that extent , i would oppose the amendment . 
madam chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
