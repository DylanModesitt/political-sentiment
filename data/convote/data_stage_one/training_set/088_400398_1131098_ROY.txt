in no way should this study delay or disrupt either phase 1 or 2 of the planned cleanup of the hudson river , any other ongoing superfund site , and i know of no party involved that wishes that delay . 
i will work with the gentleman to consider whether modifications to the language are needed to further clarify this point .
