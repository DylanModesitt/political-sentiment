mr. speaker , the gentleman has done great work , but he said this does not bar religious groups . 
from october 3 to the speaker from the catholic bishops : `` limiting eligible recipients to organizations that have as their primary purpose , '' which this bill does now , `` the provision of affordable housing , would effectively prevent catholic dioceses , parishes and catholic charities from participating. '' secondly , none of the money here would go to those other purposes . 
i agree with what the gentleman said . 
i just do not agree with what the bill said . 
this is their chance to reconcile them .
