mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule and urge its defeat . 
this is a bad bill for my state of florida . 
the bill could be made much better , including by an amendment that i have offered , that the committee on rules refused to be made in order . 
this bill , in my judgment , guts the coastal zone management act . 
what is this law ? 
this is a law that allows governors , governor jeb bush , governor arnold schwarzenegger , to have their voices heard as to where a particular facility might be sited . 
it does not give the state a right to veto the decision , just simply to have its voice heard . 
what this bill does is undermine that process that has worked very well for decades , and the rule deprives the house of representatives of an open and honest debate about the fact that this bill is tantamount to repeal of the coastal zone management act , and i do not think any member of congress wants to stand on this floor and admit or agree that we should repeal the coastal zone management act . 
we are once again , remarkably , trampling on the rights of our states . 
we are substituting the judgment of governors with bureaucrats in washington that are expected to understand our states better in terms of environmental impact , in terms of economic impacts . 
the beaches on the coast of state of the florida should be judged and policed by the governor of the state of florida , not by somebody in an agency in washington . 
i urge defeat of the rule .
