mr. chairman , i rise to support the amendment . 
i made my living in the oil and gas business . 
and to correct an earlier statement , you can determine what you are going to drill for . 
you can determine that you are going to put oil at the surface or you are going to put gas at the surface . 
that is to correct the record . 
we are in a world economy , and we are losing our jobs . 
these jobs are 100 , 000 a year-plus jobs when we lose them out of the chemical industry and the fertilizer industry . 
i was in the industry when the price went from $ 2 to $ 50 . 
we will drill this gas . 
we will simply do it before or after we lose our jobs . 
we will do it before or after people have to give up their homes to heat them .
