i thank the gentleman . 
mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i will just finish up . 
these additional inspectors and agents are essential because they would be assigned to assist local law enforcement to cut off the supply of weapons and ammunition to gang members . 
this amendment would also help local law enforcement and the batfe compile much-needed data on how weapons are obtained and used by gangs . 
this amendment is not a gun control amendment ; it is a law enforcement amendment . 
by improving our enforcement of existing gun laws , gang members will lose the dominating weaponry that permits gangs to outgun police and kill innocent people . 
mr. chairman , i believe that we should make every effort to prevent gang members from obtaining their `` weapons of mass destruction. '' i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms , and explosives continue the assault on crime in our communities while cutting off the flow of guns to gang members . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
