if the gentleman can just give me one second . 
mr. chairman , i guess what i would say in response is that i understand the questions that the gentleman from texas is raising and i understand , i guess , the consternation that he has with respect to receiving such a lengthy amendment with little notice . 
i would only say that the underlying bill is equally complex , equally dense , and that there are sections of the underlying bill that were not subjected to hearings , as well .
