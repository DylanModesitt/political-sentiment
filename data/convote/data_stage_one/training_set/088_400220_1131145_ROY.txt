mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i would point out that iowa and the corn belt are held hostage to the price of natural gas in two ways . 
it is our input cost for nitrogen fertilizer . 
ninety percent of the cost is the cost of natural gas . 
the other side is that we use it to dry grain . 
we have to have a full energy picture . 
i congratulate the gentleman for bringing this amendment , fully support it , and i urge adoption of it .
