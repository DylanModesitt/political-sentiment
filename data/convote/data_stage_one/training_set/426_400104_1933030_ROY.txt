mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman yielding . 
we have not made any decisions yet , but obviously the gentleman knows and members understand that the appropriations process did end with us passing our bills before the july 4 break . 
the senate is working on appropriations bills , and we will be doing those conferences as they present themselves . 
also , we do know that at least the first week back , we could be looking at the coast guard authorization bill and possibly a research bill from the committee on science . 
that is the first week back . 
other bills will be considered during the august district work period , and we will be able to make a more firm announcement to the members as to what we anticipate having the first week back and , in addition to that , the second week also .
