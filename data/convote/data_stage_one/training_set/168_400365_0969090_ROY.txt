mr. chairman , i am sure the president of honduras would have loved to have kept the person who killed the 26 people in his country there and tried him and punished him there ; but the fact of the matter is , the borders are leaky . 
some of us have been trying to ensure the security of the borders through various measures , like the real id act , which has been signed . 
i would hope that that concern would spread as we deal with other immigration matters such as the numbers of border patrol people that we need to put on the border . 
i support this amendment because it creates enhanced penalties for illegal aliens or those ordered deported on the grounds of having committed a crime who subsequently commit a crime of violence or a drug-trafficking crime . 
an illegal alien who commits a drug-trafficking crime or crime of violence would receive a consecutive sentence of 5 years , and an alien who previously has been deported for a crime and subsequently commits a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime would receive a consecutive sentence of 15 years . 
in addition , the amendment would require the department of homeland security to provide the national crime information center with information on illegal aliens . 
mr. chairman , i urge support of the amendment .
