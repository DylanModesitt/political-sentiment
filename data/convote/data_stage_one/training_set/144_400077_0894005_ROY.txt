mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
for the purpose of clarification , i want to quickly address the matter involving the supplemental report on h.r. 748 , the child interstate abortion notification act . 
the purpose of this supplemental report is to change the description of certain amendments considered during the committee markup and process . 
it is my understanding that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary has already prepared the supplemental report and shared its contents with the committee 's ranking minority member . 
i further understand that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is prepared to file a supplemental report immediately after the adoption of this resolution and also to place it in the & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record . 
this supplemental report will be part of the official legislative history of the bill and will amend the descriptions contained in the original report . 
this supplemental report responds directly to the questions of privilege raised by the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , both of which call for the chairman of the committee on the judiciary `` to report to the house a supplement to house report 109-51 that corrects the record by describing the five amendments with nonargumentative , objective captions. '' the text of the proposed supplemental report also includes additional dissenting views from the committee 's ranking minority describing his disagreements with the interpretation of the amendments by the majority . 
the filing of the supplemental report represents the regular order for correcting problems in earlier committee reports filed with the house . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from michigan ( mrs. miller ) xz4002761 .
