madam chairman , i rise in opposition the gentleman 's amendment . 
this is a very important issue , and we tried our best to fund it at the appropriate level . 
i have had discussions with the gentleman about trying to work with him as we move to conference to attempt to increase this line item somewhat , to address the problem that the gentleman is addressing in a very sincere way here today .
