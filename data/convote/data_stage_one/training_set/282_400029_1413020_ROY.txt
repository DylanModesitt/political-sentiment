mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i love history . 
in fact , this is not necessarily unprecedented . 
the kassebaum-solomon amendment in 1985 asked for change , and meaningful change took place . 
in 1994 , we insisted on an oversight committee and an oversight committee took place . 
and under the bipartisan helms-biden approach , once again we insisted on changes with the united nations . 
the united nations responded to it . 
this bill is keeping a tradition that is historical going back for at least 20 years in this body . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from indiana ( mr. burton ) xz4000550 .
