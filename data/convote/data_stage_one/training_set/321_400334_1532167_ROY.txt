mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
this would prohibit cms from spending any funds related to using social security numbers on a medicare identification card . 
it would really interfere with the operation of the current system . 
this is a long-time use of social security numbers . 
it is an outgrowth of the claims process . 
i think it is important from the standpoint of avoiding fraud . 
the cost of converting the system for 43 million medicare beneficiaries would be substantial , both in beneficiary education , system reprogramming and related costs . 
while cms may well convert to some type of an electronic identification system over time , and i think that will happen , in the meantime to try to make a change at this point would be wrong . 
this amendment would limit their ability to effectively deal with it . 
and , of course , they have got the new drug benefit to implement . 
i think it is just the wrong time to start tampering with a system that has been in place for a long time . 
i would urge members to vote against that if this amendment comes to a vote . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
