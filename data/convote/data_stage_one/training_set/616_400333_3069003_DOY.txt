mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i think working out the details in this bill is a classic example as to how we can be bipartisan when we really try . 
there is no question that foreign policy and trade should not be a republican or democratic issue . 
and the gentleman from maryland ( mr. cardin ) xz4000640 made up his mind that we were going to stick to it to make certain that some of our concerns about the basic protection of workers was going to be included in the bill . 
and while the language is not specifically in the bill , in talking with the representatives from the bahrain government , especially the ambassador that showed us a sincere desire to make certain that he accommodated not republicans or democrats , but his respect for this body , we were able to persuade most of the members on our side that this was something worth doing , not only because of economic reasons , but because of the courageous acts that were taken in the middle east by this very small country . 
mr. speaker , i yield 30 minutes to the distinguished gentlemen from california ( mr. stark ) xz4003870 and request unanimous consent that he be allowed to manage the time .
