when the gentlewoman says she is not in need of further time , i think she is being very kind to her colleagues in the republican study committee . 
she is being very kind to our colleagues who miswrote this amendment . 
the only thing that i would differ with the gentlewoman is she said there are unintended consequences . 
no , to her they are unintended . 
to the people who think poor people vote too much , they were intended . 
but we can work together to fix it . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. kanjorski ) xz4002100 , the ranking member of the subcommittee of jurisdiction here , who has been one of the major architects of what we believe is mostly a very good piece of legislation .
