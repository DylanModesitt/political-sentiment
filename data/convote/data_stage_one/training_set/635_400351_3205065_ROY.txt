mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
mr. speaker , i can not think of anything more scary , anything worse than working one 's lifetime , working hard every day and then seeing their pension go before them , seeing their pension get terminated . 
that is the worst possible thing that could happen to a worker and to a family . 
we have a system that needs fixing , mr. speaker . 
we have a pension system that has some loopholes where companies could not put money in their pension plan when they needed to , to make them funded , and then we have a system that disincentivizes companies from putting more money in their pension plan to prefund the workers and employees when they have one and they have the will to do so . 
that is wrong , and that needs to be fixed . 
yet , on the other hand , mr. speaker , as this legislation was being drafted , we want to make sure we get to a time where companies fully fund their workers ' pensions . 
getting to that transition was difficult , and i want to thank the chairman of the ways and means committee , mr. thomas ; the chairman of the education and the workforce committee , mr. boehner , for working with us to address our concerns specifically on behalf of the auto sector . 
because of this , the issues surrounding credit balances , plant shutdown benefits and those things that were raised by the auto sector , by the uaw , have been addressed in this legislation , are being addressed in this manager 's amendment . 
i opposed this bill in committee . 
i was the only republican to do so . 
but , mr. speaker , we have fixed this legislation . 
this legislation is good for labor . 
this legislation is good for management . 
but , most importantly , this legislation is good to the employees and the workers of america . 
i encourage and i ask for a yes vote on this bill because it is fixed . 
it is good , and it should pass .
