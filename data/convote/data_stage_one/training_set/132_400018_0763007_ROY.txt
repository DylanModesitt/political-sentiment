mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , it is only a page amendment , section 631 . 
it authorizes $ 10 million each year for 2006 , 2007 , 2008 . 
it would create cooperative cost-sharing agreements between the department of energy and the domestic uranium producers , and these cost-sharing agreements would be competitively selected demonstration projects . 
so it is a 3-year $ 10 million per-year , openly competed demonstration program to try to find new ways to improve mining technologies with the appropriate environmental restoration technologies . 
but the part that i want to read into the record is , and i have great respect for the congressional research service , but it very plainly states in section c of section 631 , and i am going to read this verbatim : `` limitation . 
no activities funded under this section may be carried out in the state of new mexico. '' that is the plain language of the section : `` no activities funded under this section may be carried out in the state of new mexico. '' now , the gentleman from new mexico has every right to offer an amendment to strip the section if he has some concerns generically about its impact nationally ; but if he has any concern about this program being used in his home state , it is not going to happen , because it very clearly states in this amendment , this section c of the section 631 , it can not happen .
