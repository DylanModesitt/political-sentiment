mr. chairman , i respect those who choose to serve our country in the military . 
i also understand that successful recruiting is critical to the military 's ability to protect our country . 
but we also must protect the privacy of our children . 
on top of mr. honda 's discussion , mr. chairman , according to the washington post , the pentagon is now developing a comprehensive invasive recruiting database on high-school and college students who are age 16 or older . 
the database will include personal information about these young women and men , including their birth dates , social security numbers , e-mail addresses , grade-point averages , ethnicity and what subjects they are studying . 
and , apparently , the pentagon will be able , without notifying citizens , to share this data for non-military purposes , including with law enforcement agencies and state tax authorities . 
more than ever , this highlights the administration 's gall in believing they have the right to personal information about student rights above parents . 
if their war was justified , if the american people were not fed up with it , young people would volunteer -- but they are n't , and , they wo n't , and , that is the very reason this invasive program has come up . 
for these reasons , i encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting parents and children and their privacy . 
vote for the honda amendment .
