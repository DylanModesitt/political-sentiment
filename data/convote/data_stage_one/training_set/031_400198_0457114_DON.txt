mr. chairman , my amendment is very simple . 
it adds $ 50 million for disaster assistance and $ 50 million for refugee assistance in sudan and other african countries . 
if this amendment passes , the house product would still be $ 550 million below the president 's request . 
so for colleagues that argue we are spending too much money , this amendment is fiscally prudent . 
but more importantly , adopting this amendment is quite frankly the right thing to do . 
mr. chairman , my amendment could be the most decent , moral and effective $ 100 million spent in this bill . 
this $ 100 million in disaster relief and refugee assistance would go very far in alleviating the multiple disasters and refugee crisis in africa . 
most of africa 's urgent humanitarian needs are shockingly affordable . 
sadly , what we have been missing is the political will to stand up and do something . 
mr. chairman , the president speaks often about ending evil , about reaching into your heart and doing the right thing . 
the number of deaths , over 1 , 300 a day in sudan and the democratic republic of the congo , that could be prevented would truly be ending evil and we know this is the right thing to do . 
mr. chairman , the only way for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing . 
i urge a `` yea '' vote on the jackson amendment .
