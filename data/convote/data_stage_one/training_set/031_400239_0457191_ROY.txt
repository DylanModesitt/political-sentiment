mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i appreciate the remarks of my colleague from illinois . 
i would suggest that in voting for this amendment , members would be voting against the view of our commander in chief , the president of the united states . 
the secretary of state has spoken very strongly about the urgency of this matter . 
there is little doubt that we have the appropriate place , we have the plans in place , we can get it done quickly . 
we need the money up front . 
that is why it is here . 
because of that , mr. chairman , i urge a `` no '' vote on the upton amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
