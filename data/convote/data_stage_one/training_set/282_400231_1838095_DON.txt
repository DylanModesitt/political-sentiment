mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment . 
it is of critical importance that the united states not be outgunned or outmaneuvered by narcotics traffickers either in the streets of our towns or on the high seas . 
it is very disturbing to learn that drug traffickers are in fact developing their own navies with at-sea refueling capabilities for their drug cargo vessels , yet our own coast guard is not similarly equipped when it hunts and pursues these deep water vessels in the eastern pacific . 
this amendment will authorize $ 50 million for the next two fiscal years to the department of state international narcotics and law enforcement bureau to purchase or lease a maritime refueling support vessel to refuel u.s. coast guard and other drug interdiction vessels in the eastern pacific . 
in the drug war , unilateral disarmament is the worst position to be in . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
