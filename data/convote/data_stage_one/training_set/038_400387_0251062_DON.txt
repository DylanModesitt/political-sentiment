mr. speaker , i rise today to oppose this misguided legislation to limit the ability of average americans to seek redress for injury and harm caused by corporate malfeasance . 
do n't be fooled by the title of this bill . 
congress is not standing up for the average american under this bill . 
it 's not fixing inequities in our judicial system . 
it 's making those inequities worse by giving the upper hand to big corporations . 
i wo n't vote for this republican-sponsored hoax . 
it unfairly threatens the very people we are all elected to protect . 
when the so-called party of local control makes it a top priority to move class action cases from state to federal court , there 's an ulterior motive . 
do n't believe the myth my republican colleagues want to sell you . 
class action suits are n't frivolous . 
they allow average americans financially unable to launch a judicial battle on their own the means to seek redress for injury or death of a loved one . 
they empower consumers to challenge wrongdoings by wealthy corporations who would otherwise ignore their appeal . 
i do n't think that the american public would be satisfied knowing that if this bill passes , the accountability of companies like eron would be held less accountable . 
and the makers of vioxx and other dangerous drugs would be held less accountable . 
it is truthful , law-abiding citizens who will lose if this bill becomes law , apparently , in america today , we have government for , by , and of corporate interests and not the people . 
i ask my colleagues to stand up for real people and vote against this shameful bill .
