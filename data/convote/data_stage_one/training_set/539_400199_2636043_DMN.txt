mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h. res. 509 as reported out of the committee on rules last night relative to our debate of the gse legislation , h.r. 1461 . 
while many substantive amendments were made in order , the committee blocked what we undoubtedly consider one of the most substantive amendments that was offered by the gentleman from massachusetts , mr. frank , the ranking member of the body from which the underlying measure was discharged . 
the gentleman 's amendment would have removed language contained in the current manager 's amendment that bars organizations with proven experience in mobilizing community support and resources -- a nonpartisan initiative . 
in addition , the manager 's amendment would constrain the ability of experienced faith-based and community-based organizations to successfully compete for the affordable housing funds that are proposed in the underlying bill . 
my district of houston , tx , has a plethora of faith-based organizations that have plans that would provide much-needed affordable housing for the surrounding community . 
our affordable housing stock has suffered for a long time , and i have been working steadfastly with the secretary of housing and urban development to facilitate the obtainment of opportunities by these groups . 
the nugatory provisions in the manager 's amendment will contravene the hard work that i and many other members have done to this end . 
while i applaud the effort made by the administration to remove barriers to full participation in federal programs and funding faith-based entities , proposals such as the manager 's amendment will bar these groups from access to this funding while for-profit agencies remain free to engage in the democratic process which is every american 's birthright . 
this double-standard must be removed . 
it contravenes the spirit of the u.s. constitution . 
mr. speaker , i oppose this rule .
