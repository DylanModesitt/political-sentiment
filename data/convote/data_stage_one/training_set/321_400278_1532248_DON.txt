mr. chairman , the gentleman has exactly made the point . 
these casinos now hire thousands of workers who are nonresidents of the reservation , who are not enrolled members of the tribe . 
if the tribe chooses not to grant them any rights , then they have no rights . 
we lecture countries all over the world that you can not do this to workers , that you have to have minimum standards . 
but right here in the middle of the united states , under this amendment , a tribe can grant to their workers no rights . 
that is just untenable . 
and we understand how strongly held sovereignty is . 
it is fundamental and basic to these tribes . 
we also understand how fundamental and basic the right to organize and the freedom of association is to the workers . 
we have been trying to work that out . 
this amendment is not helpful in working that out . 
but the gentleman is exactly right . 
you can end up with thousands of american workers having no rights . 
this is like the situation you had in the northern mariana islands , where you had people who could not get a minimum wage , who could not get protection of immigration laws . 
this is re-creating this on these lands .
