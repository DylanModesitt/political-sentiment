mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment . 
there is a problem in america . 
there is no question but that there is a problem . 
we do not solve that problem by shifting responsibility to corporations . 
it would be good if corporations did perfect things , but we live in an imperfect world where parents have the ability to turn off the television , parents have the ability to teach their children what to eat and how to eat well . 
and , interestingly , food that is better for you actually costs less . 
parents have the ability to deal with these issues in ways that this congress and industry can not do . 
i urge my colleagues to reject this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
