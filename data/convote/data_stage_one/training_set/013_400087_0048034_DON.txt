mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i am disappointed that the chairman will not support this amendment . 
i think it is a reasonable amendment , one that i do not think in any way disrupts what the intention of the bill by the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 , the sponsor , is , that is , to limit the number . 
we certainly are limiting the number in this amendment to six as opposed to what the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 would do per calendar year , which would be four . 
we are still limiting it to six . 
i think in the most recent history , we have not done more than six within a congress . 
this again will help to free the hands of members to introduce gold medal legislation for people who they believe are worthy of that great honor . 
i would just like to point out again that the founding fathers in their wisdom did not have as many people that they had to honor during that time . 
we have grown more than tenfold since the founding of this nation . 
there have been many more events that have taken place since the founding fathers initially granted those initial gold medals , and i think that once again if we do not pass this , we will further be limiting our ability to ensure that those who are most deserving will receive this great honor . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
