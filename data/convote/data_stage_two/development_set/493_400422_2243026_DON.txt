mr. speaker , one of the things i have been terribly worried about is the inability of congress to move quickly to do something about the victims of katrina . 
i am very , very worried that we are going to be seen as a body that can not get its act together when we are confronted with this terrible disaster . 
we have an opportunity to utilize resources that will not be taken from our budget . 
we have an opportunity to use substantial resources that could be applied toward the rebuilding of homes , to getting people started again ; and if we keep fumbling and if we keep fiddling , then we are going to come under great criticism because we are not doing what we can do . 
so i would just simply urge all of my colleagues , do not play with this . 
there are people who are suffering and people who are depending on us . 
we have got a great way by which to provide real assistance . 
let us get it done .
