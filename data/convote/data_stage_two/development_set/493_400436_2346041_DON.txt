mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , kill head start ?

shame on the gentleman for thinking that it is any other way . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. holt ) xz4001840 , a member of the committee on education and the workforce .
