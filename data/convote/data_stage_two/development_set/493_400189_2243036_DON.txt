i thank the gentleman . 
i would simply add again that as the gentleman indicated , trying to go regular order , obviously , both sides understand that these are things we need to move with great dispatch so we can help the people that need help and get it to them when they need the help . 
we are all for that . 
on the supplemental , the president has indicated there is going to be a need for another supplemental . 
do you know when we might consider such a supplemental ; how much that supplemental might be for ? 
and if we start considering it early , while the $ 52 billion is still available to be expended to assist those , it will give us a little bit of time to go through the process that the gentleman indicates is the best process . 
i yield to the gentleman .
