reclaiming my time , and i agree with you that is not a problem . 
please convey the democratic congratulations to the chairman and more importantly his wife , the mother . 
two last bills i will ask you about , mr. leader , and i appreciate the time we are taking on this . 
reconciliation : there was a discussion about putting off reconciliation . 
we have put off reconciliation at least until the end of the month , as i understand it probably until october . 
can you tell me whether or not we still anticipate reconciliation moving forward and , if so , are there going to be two bills ? 
one the $ 35 billion in mandatory spending cuts among which is $ 10 billion in medicaid cuts , and/or the $ 70 billion in tax cuts that was included in the budget reconciliation instructions .
