mr. chairman , in the original welfare reform bill by president clinton , this provision was never in it . 
second , it was unconstitutional , and it was never promulgated by president clinton in the rulemaking . 
he does not support that provision . 
if you want to support something that president clinton believed in , then try fiscal responsibility and start balancing the budget . 
this is not what he believes , and the gentleman from ohio knows that , mr. chairman .
