mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume to respond to the chairman of the committee . 
the rights for faith-based organizations are already protected when they use their own funds .

that is what we oppose . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. menendez ) xz4002720 , the chair of the democratic caucus .
