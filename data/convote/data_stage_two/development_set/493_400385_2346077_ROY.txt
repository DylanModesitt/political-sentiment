mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute . 
mr. chairman , there was no testimony at any hearings about this subject . 
the only reference in the hearings , i believe , was actually on the senate side from the deputy mayor of memphis who complained that he did not have decision-making powers to make some changes that he wanted to make , but it was not financial abuse or financial waste . 
i have asked the committee staff , as well as the chairman , to come up with an example . 
there is not an example . 
there are problems in the whole system ; but mostly it is the grantees and the board that have been the problems . 
the board is not as engaged like the parents . 
in this case , it is not a question of whether the parents have veto power . 
the parents have the power , the board has shared power , and the parents have the primary power , the board has the veto power . 
the parent council is 51 percent parents , 49 percent community leaders who are actively engaged . 
the board tends to be leading citizens of the community who come in and review that . 
we are gutting , for a pat on the head , saying we like your opinion , but not your vote . 
you are not good enough to vote , but you are good enough to give your opinion . 
this is an empowerment program by the people who are running it , it has worked well , and we should not change it .
