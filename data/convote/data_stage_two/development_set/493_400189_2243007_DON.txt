mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman . 
i realize the problems of doing that ; but many of our members , particularly those who come from far away , are concerned about traveling on that wednesday , as the gentleman knows , which makes it problematic because we will have to be very late thursday . 
we will obviously accommodate what the majority believes it is going to do . 
in that regard , last week , we had thought we probably , or might , be in tomorrow . 
we are not going to be in tomorrow . 
can the majority leader give us a view on what might be the status of next friday ? 
i yield to my friend .
