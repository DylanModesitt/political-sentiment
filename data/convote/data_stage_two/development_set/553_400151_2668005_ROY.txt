madam speaker , in response to some of the comments that were made , i just want to hold up this document that lists over 300 groups in support of lara , the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 , and i will include them in the record . 
i would like to also point out that the federal judicial center was in opposition to class action reform , which we passed in the previous congress and in the 108th by a vote in this body of 279 to 149 .
