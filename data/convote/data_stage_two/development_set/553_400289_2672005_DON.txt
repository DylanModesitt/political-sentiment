mr. chairman , i observe the gentleman tells us that president bush assures us of the problem of frivolous lawsuits . 
president bush assured us there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq and a lot of other nonsense . 
so i do not give that too much credence . 
mr. chairman , i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 .
