mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
let me just say to the gentleman from florida that we do not believe that the way to increase the solvency of social security is to decrease the solvency of social security . 
everybody on our side of the aisle is prepared to work in a bipartisan way to increase the solvency of social security . 
what we are objecting to is this privatization scheme . 
let me also say to the gentleman , because he questioned why i said that the republican majority of this congress has a budget that will create a government without a conscience , the reason why i say that is because this budget would cut $ 5.3 billion from the department of agriculture , cutting food stamps and other programs that are vital to america 's farmers . 
this budget would cut 21.4 billion from education , cutting student loans and higher education spending . 
he brags about the increase in money for no child left behind , but we never properly funded no child left behind . 
and our teachers and our principals and our superintendents are screaming about the fact that we have passed an unfunded mandate to them . 
this bill would cut $ 20 billion , mostly from the medicaid program . 
it would cut $ 270 million in spending from section 8 and other housing and homelessness programs . 
it would cut money from the witness protection program , $ 103 million from transportation . 
it would cut $ 798 million for veterans health care . 
it would cut the earned income tax credit . 
it would cut money for unemployment insurance programs . 
i mean , this is why i say that this is a budget that creates a government without a conscience . 
we are turning our backs on people who need our help , and i think that is wrong . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
