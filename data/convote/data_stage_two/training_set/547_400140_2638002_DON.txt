mr. chairman , i yield myself as much time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i agree with a great deal of what the gentleman from ohio ( mr. oxley ) xz4003070 has said , as i agree with a great deal of what is in the bill . 
in the nature of parliamentary debate , we will be focusing on some specific points where i disagree , but i do not want that to obscure the fact that there is a great deal of agreement . 
mr. chairman , i yield 4 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. waters ) xz4004220 who as ranking member of the minority on the housing subcommittee has had a major role in shaping our position and in the impact of the affordable housing front .
