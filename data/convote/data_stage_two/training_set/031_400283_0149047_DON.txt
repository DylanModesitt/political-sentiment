mr. chairman , the problem with this bill is that it is an immigration bill posing as an identification bill . 
instead of listening to what the states told us needed to be done to make driver 's licenses more secure , what we have done is to basically make state motor vehicle employees unwitting immigration agents . 
it does little to improve homeland security , and it is certain to prove overwhelming and ineffective . 
now , i support what the gentleman from virginia ( chairman tom davis ) is trying to do to improve the integrity of driver 's licenses , but i find it curious that the leadership of the house has chosen to largely ignore the multiple references in the 9/11 commission report to the value of on-card biometric technology in improving the integrity of identification cards . 
the problem is that these digital images are not sufficient . 
matching the image with the face is more prone to error than the technology that would use biometric data . 
two fingerprints transformed into numeric algorithm , that works . 
what we have here does not work . 
i think we are going to find the states letting us know that . 
unfortunately , it will be too late . 
we will miss an opportunity .
