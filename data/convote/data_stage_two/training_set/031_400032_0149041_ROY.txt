mr. chairman , our committee chairman is exactly right ; we can go to page 384 in the 9/11 commission report . 
and i encourage all of my constituents to do this , look at this : `` for terrorists , travel documents are as important as weapons. '' and what is the number one travel document ? 
it is a driver 's license . 
it is a huge gaping hole that we have . 
that is why it is imperative that we pass the real id act today and we set a national standard . 
maybe that is just too much common sense for some of my friends that do not want us to do that , but if someone is going to use a travel document as a driver 's license and use it as a way to circumvent our laws and harm our citizens , then it is imperative that we close that loophole . 
having standards that all the states would follow is a great way to close that loophole . 
i would encourage my colleagues to support the real id act . 
i thank the gentleman from virginia ( chairman tom davis ) for his good work on this issue , and i encourage our constituents to read this report and see the importance of the actions that we are taking today .
