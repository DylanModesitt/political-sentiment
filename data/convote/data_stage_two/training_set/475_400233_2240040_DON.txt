mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman from new york for the time . 
the citizens of louisiana , mississippi and alabama deserve nothing less than the citizens of new york and new jersey and connecticut , those in pennsylvania and our own pentagon who received an independent commission , one that was heralded for its results and for its independence and its ability to work together . 
it served as both healing the nation and bringing people together . 
the citizens of those states , the residents of the city of new orleans deserve the same as the great city of new york . 
the citizens who were stranded in the superdome or in the convention center deserve nothing less than what this nation received with an independent commission . 
the spouses of so many of our members , who have not been recognized at all , deserve nothing less than to make sure the efforts that have gone on already and the answers that everybody seeks are provided by an independent commission , an independent commission blessed by both the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hastert ) xz4001690 and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 , coming together in the way that we should as a country . 
we all stand prepared to work together . 
the citizens of louisiana and mississippi and the great city of new orleans deserve nothing less .
