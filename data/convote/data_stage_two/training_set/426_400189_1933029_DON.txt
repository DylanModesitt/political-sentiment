mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , in light of the fact , mr. leader , i will simply observe that if we get all of those things moving we are going to have a lot of work to do next week , and i presume our members ought to be prepared for long days and , clearly , if we get all of that done , it will be friday late before we get out of here . 
in light of the fact we will not have a colloquy next week because we will be going on recess for the summer work period , can the gentleman tell us what he anticipates might be on the agenda when we come back on september 6 , what might be on the agenda early in the september weeks ? 
clearly , appropriations bills conference reports , to the extent they are done , will be on the calendar , but other than that , can the gentleman enlighten us as to what your thoughts are ? 
i yield to the leader .
