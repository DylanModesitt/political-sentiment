mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition of s. 5 , the so-called `` class action fairness act. '' this bill will send the majority of class action suits from state to federal courts , making it more difficult for people who have been unfairly hurt to collect compensation for their injuries . 
federal courts are already overwhelmed by a large number of drug and immigration cases , and they do n't have the time or the resources to deal with complex issues of state law . 
this bill has it all wrong . 
instead of punishing individuals who pursue frivolous lawsuits , this bill will punish innocent people who have been wrongfully hurt . 
this bill is a payoff to large companies and special interests . 
it takes rights away from consumers in order to protect drug manufacturers , insurance companies , hmos and negligent doctors . 
there is no accountability on their part . 
it is not `` frivolous '' for an innocent person who has been harmed through no fault of their own to seek compensation for their injuries . 
when a child is disabled or maimed by a preventable error , it is not frivolous to seek damages from the company responsible for the injury . 
this is a bill that 's going to significantly harm small consumers who want to hold large companies accountable for defrauding them . 
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on s. 5 .
