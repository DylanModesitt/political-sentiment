mr. speaker , it is because of today 's outdated pension rules , workers , retirees and taxpayers all stand to lose unless we act now to reform our pension system . 
under current law , employers have been allowed to underestimate their future pension liabilities and to make promises they simply can not keep . 
the recent example of united airlines underscores the need for reform . 
united pilots plan was severely underfunded , yet the company was not required to make cash contributions to that plan in 8 years prior to its termination . 
the legislation before us today strikes a careful balance between preserving the defined benefit pension system for workers and ensuring that employers properly fund their plans . 
this bill provides workers with meaningful disclosure about the status of their pensions , and it protects taxpayers from a possible multibillion dollar bail-out of the pbgc , which insures the pensions of some 44 million workers . 
but h.r. 2830 contains other important provisions aimed at improving the economic security of retired americans . 
for example , it provides retired firefighters and police officers , who often retire early without medicare coverage , with a tax break on pension withdrawals to pay for health insurance premiums . 
this provision enjoys strong bipartisan support and offers a small measure to protect against exorbitant health care costs that follow a career spent responding to emergencies . 
all together , mr. speaker , this bill represents a balanced approach to protecting the interest of workers , retirees and taxpayers , and i urge my colleagues to support its passage .
