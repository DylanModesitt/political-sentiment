mr. speaker , times of tragedy should not be windfalls for opportunists in the wake of hurricane katrina gas prices fluctuated to upwards of $ 6.00 in some communities . 
prosecution for price gouging is generally a state matter unless it involves some form of collusion or other activity in violation of federal laws . 
only 23 states have anti-gouging laws on the books , and definitions vary widely . 
only 13 of those states have emergency anti-gouging laws . 
the aftermath of hurricane katrina has shown that the patchwork of state anti-gouging laws does not work to deter opportunists . 
while the federal trade commission ( ftc ) monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust violations in the petroleum industry , there is no federal law to prohibit price gouging by individual bad actors . 
i welcome h.r. 3893 the gasoline for america 's security ( gas ) act of 2005 price gouging language . 
it incorporates penalties of up to $ 11 , 000 per violation and covers retail and wholesale sellers of crude oil , gasoline , diesel fuel and home heating oil . 
the gas act requires the ftc to enact a price gouging definition as soon as possible within six months , an improvement from the potential delay in the language reported out of committee . 
the house should pass a strong price gouging law that would be in effect in disaster areas . 
this bill includes a strong national policy providing stiff penalties for gasoline price gouging . 
times of tragedy should not be windfalls for opportunists . 
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 3893 , the gasoline for america 's security act of 2005 .
