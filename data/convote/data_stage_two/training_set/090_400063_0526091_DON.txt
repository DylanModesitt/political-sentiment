mr. speaker , you have heard all the legal arguments , all the moral arguments . 
we see these things differently , and i understand that . 
i am here to speak for myself . 
i have a living will that i wrote years ago , and i will check it myself as many americans will . 
the bottom line is , i do not want you interfering with my wife and me . 
leave us alone . 
let us make our own decisions . 
it is not up to you . 
that has always been the way it has been in this country , and that is the way it should be . 
for 6 years i have been hearing how the nuclear family is all we care about . 
now we do not . 
stay out of my family . 
if you can do it here , you can do it to me . 
you can do it to every one of my constituents . 
leave us alone . 
let my nuclear family make my decisions and my wife 's decisions without your input .
