mr. speaker , reluctantly i stand here and oppose this legislation , primarily because we did earmark some money last year for programs , and now we are just cutting them off period , no prewarning , no salaries , no billing rent , no heat , nothing , just kicking them out . 
i do not think that is the right thing to do . 
if you had grandfathered those programs in , i believe it would be a lot better . 
i would like to ask the gentleman from ohio , do you save any money or does the money just go back into the other programs that your committee decided ought to get funding ?
