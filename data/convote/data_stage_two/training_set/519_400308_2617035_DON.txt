mr. speaker , if the gentleman will continue to yield , one of the things that the 30-something group has been talking about , and it relates directly to what he said , is this idea that there should be a bipartisan commission in the aftermath of hurricane katrina . 
and it is the same principle that the gentleman from massachusetts brought up , that they just do not want any kind of investigation of themselves . 
the republicans control the white house , the senate , the house of representative . 
they know there are problems that came out of hurricane katrina . 
they know they are responsible . 
they do not want any investigation by a bipartisan commission because they do not want an investigation of themselves . 
they are afraid of what it is going to reveal . 
and that is the problem around here . 
they do not want oversight . 
they do not want accountability . 
they do not want any kind of effort on a bipartisan basis , which would happen with the gentleman 's subcommittee , because it might reveal that they have basically created a lot of problems and screwed up on a lot of things . 
that is what they are against .
