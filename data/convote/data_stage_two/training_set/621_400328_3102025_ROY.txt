addressing the gentleman 's concerns , yesterday 414 members of the house voted for amt relief . 
i am unclear which piece of that the gentleman is referring to that the democrats had that paid for that as it relates to that . 
and the gentleman , in reference to his concern about the deficit , which is legitimate and shared by all of us about the growth of the deficit , failed to point out that the deficit has gone down over $ 100 billion in the last year . 
the size of the u.s. deficit dropped and finally , to the gentleman 's point , he illustrated and spoke very clearly and directly about the democratic intentions with regard to tax policy . 
they want to pick and choose the winners in american society , and we want everyone , everyone on equal footing to have the opportunity to achieve their piece of the american dream . 
we do not propose to pick winners and losers in economic policy and tax policy . 
we say everybody has got a shot at making the most of their opportunities in this country . 
everybody has got a shot at paying less in taxes on capital gains . 
everybody has got a shot at paying less in taxes on dividends that are paid by companies that support all americans . 
everybody has got an opportunity to go to college through the tax incentives that are in there for higher education opportunities . 
everybody has got an opportunity to achieve home ownership mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
