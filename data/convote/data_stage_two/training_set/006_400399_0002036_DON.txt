mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 for yielding me time . 
mr. speaker , my question to the gentleman concerns the change to the rules that would allow members to use campaign funds to purchase cell phones . 
as you know , there is a law that prohibits a member of congress from using the resources of their office or their office to solicit campaign funds . 
it is my hope that allowing campaign cell phones to be used in a congressional office is not in any way a back-door attempt to allow a member to use a campaign cell phone from their congressional office or any federal facility to raise funds to get around this prohibition that currently exists in law .
