mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from michigan ( mr. stupak ) xz4003910 and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 if they are on the floor . 
i know the gentleman from michigan ( mr. stupak ) xz4003910 is . 
i do not know if the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 is or not . 
first of all , i want to say that i think it is good that we have a democrat substitute . 
i think it adds to the debate . 
it certainly adds to the fairness of the debate . 
but i do have some questions for my good friend from michigan . 
on page 2 , title i , section 101 , it basically says if a president has issued a declaration that there is an energy emergency , it begins to talk about a price that is unconscionably excessive . 
that is line 4. what is unconscionably excessive ?
