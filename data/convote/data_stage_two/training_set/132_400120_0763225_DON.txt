mr. chairman , there is a simple test this energy bill should pass . 
is big oil going to see their largess before the american people see relief at the pump ? 
the answer 's yes , and that 's exactly what 's wrong with this legislation . 
it is n't a bill written for the benefit of the american people , but by high-priced lobbyists for the benefit of their high-priced clients . 
the energy department says this bill does n't lower gas prices . 
in fact , it could actually raise gas prices by 3 to 5 cents per gallon according to the department 's independent budget analysis . 
even president bush said this bill subsidizes the oil and gas companies and that he would have written it differently . 
the energy bill is supposed to provide this nation with a comprehensive energy policy , but what 's written here is an $ 8 billion give-away to big oil . 
mr. chairman , yesterday the president said , `` i wish i could simply wave a magic wand and lower gas prices tomorrow. '' well , mr. president , i wish that i could wave a magic wand and get your administration and this congress out of the pockets of big oil companies . 
then maybe we could begin the people 's work .
