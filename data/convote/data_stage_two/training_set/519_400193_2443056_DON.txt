mr. speaker , this bill is a giant missed opportunity . 
we had an opportunity to do something significant . 
kennedy said we were going to go to the moon in 10 years ; this bill will not get us to cleveland . 
and the reason is it invests in old technology . 
did kennedy challenge the country to invest in propeller plane technology ? 
here we are simply investing in oil fossil fuel technology , a giveaway to the oil and gas industry of millions and billions of dollars of taxpayer money . 
we need a new apollo energy project . 
h.r. 2828 will get us there with new technologies and fuel-efficient cars , new technologies and new productive capabilities in wind and solar and wave power and a whole slew of other things . 
we need new ideas , we need a new vision , not an old giveaway to oil and gas . 
mr. speaker , this bill is one small misstep for man and one giant leap backwards for mankind , and it should be defeated .
