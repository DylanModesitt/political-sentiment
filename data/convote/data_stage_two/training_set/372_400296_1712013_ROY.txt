mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. andrews ) xz4000080 , my good friend , and believe me he is , i want him to be well aware that i am not certainly trying to hire two lawyers . 
you can be certain of that . 
but we do think some legalese is advisable on the commission . 
but being a lawyer is only one of three criteria . 
i know that you know that . 
the other part that i just want to mention to you is that when we changed this commission to have five members so it actually will work , if you have got a better idea how to make a commission work that is totally useless right now , with three members , of course i have always been open to hear that , but we think five may well do it ; but it will take three members to form a quorum , not two . 
that is for sure . 
i appreciate you bringing that up so i can clarify that . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
