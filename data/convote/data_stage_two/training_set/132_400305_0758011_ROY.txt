madam speaker , i appreciate the opportunity to review some of the facts and figures that we have in the committee . 
i appreciate the gentleman 's question , that is , the amount of jobs of course that would be created . 
i am saying high-paying professional jobs , not only for the construction phase of building a new refinery which is millions and millions of dollars , but certainly for the operation phase . 
as we operate these refineries , we have more and more technology and we call upon these professionals for a higher degree of professionalism . 
as a result of that , we are not talking about some of these jobs that can simply be replaced at a moment 's notice . 
so one of the things that we have to do , along with the construction of the refinery , along with the potential operation of the refinery , is we have to prepare educating the chemical engineers in our colleges , and there have not been really jobs , at least in the united states that have been forthcoming because of the lack of appreciation , if you will , for the refinery business in the united states and for the gas and oil business in the united states . 
a lot of these high-paying jobs have gone overseas , as well as the education opportunities . 
we are going to have to incentivize our education system to gear up not only for the construction of the plants but for the potential operations of them . 
when you look down the road at it , it has got tremendous possibilities of what it can do for our economy .
