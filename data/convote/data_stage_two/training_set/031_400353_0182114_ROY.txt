mr. chairman , on september 11 , we were attacked by terrorists who took advantage of weaknesses in our border security . 
after infiltrating our country , the terrorists were able to conceal their real identities , and thereby plot their attacks without fear of being apprehended . 
if we , as a congress , want to seriously address the problem of terrorism , then we must address the issue of border security . 
for this reason , i rise to express my support for the real id act . 
this bill contains urgent border security reforms that were not addressed in the intelligence reform bill that president bush signed into law in december . 
foremost in this bill are provisions that would prevent terrorists from obtaining a united states driver 's license . 
without a license , potential terrorists will have a much harder time opening a bank account , traveling , and conducting other business necessary to plot an attack . 
i think we all understand that preserving freedom is not an easy process . 
freedom is a difficult journey filled with enemies who will try to destroy it if they are left unchecked . 
for this reason , i strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the real id act .
