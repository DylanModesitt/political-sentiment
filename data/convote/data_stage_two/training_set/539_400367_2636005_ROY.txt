mr. speaker , it is right out there in front of everybody : republicans are good on policy and , evidently , the democrats do not like the politics . 
the policy is what this financial services committee is all about . 
that is why they produced this great bill . 
i am pleased to yield 3 minutes at this time to the gentleman from florida ( mr. feeney ) xz4001310 who serves on that committee .
