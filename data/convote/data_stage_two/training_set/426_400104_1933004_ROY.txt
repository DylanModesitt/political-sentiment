mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman yielding . 
there is no way that we can tell what hour of the day on friday that we might be finished with our work . 
as the gentleman knows , next week is going to be a typical pre-district work period week . 
we have several bills to consider , as well as multiple potential conference reports . 
because of the unpredictability of conference reports , i would hesitate to even make firm commitments for any of the week . 
for now , i would note that our plan is to consider both postal reform and small business health plans on tuesday , and after that we will have to see where various components are and how they come together .
