mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i would like to thank yleem poblete and paul ostburg sanz , long and dedicated , hardworking members , staffers on our committee on these measures and the work of the subcommittee on the middle east and central asia . 
i would like to thank chairman hyde of the international relations committee , for understanding the need to support the lebanese people at this critical time , and moving this resolution quickly through the committee . 
i would also like to commend our leadership for their commitment to freedom and democracy for all the people of the middle east . 
lastly , i must make special mention of the efforts and cooperation of our subcommittee ranking member , gary ackerman , and especially our full committee ranking member , tom lantos . 
tom lantos has experienced first hand what happens when one appeases dictators and ignores the oppression of human beings . 
we can not stand idly by and allow syria to continue to deny the lebanese people their rights and their nation . 
thanks to the cooperation of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , we are able to send a clear and unified message to both the syrian oppressors and to the lebanese people . 
as we did with the syrian accountability and lebanese sovereignty restoration , we have an opportunity today , by supporting h. con . 
res. 32 , to demonstrate a united front and show that freedom transcends party lines , geographic borders , and language barriers . 
when it comes to freedom and democracy , the u.s. is speaking with one voice , as the lebanese people are speaking with one voice . 
in so doing , we become one with our brothers and sisters in lebanon as they seek to remove the shackles of syrian tyranny and occupation . 
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution .
