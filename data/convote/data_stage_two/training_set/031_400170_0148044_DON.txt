mr. speaker , the gentleman from georgia and i are on the committee on rules , and we know this measure did not come up until 2 hours just before we went in there . 
we also know there were no hearings . 
we also know that the 9/11 commission went much further than what the gentleman presented here today . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. berman ) xz4000250 , a member of the committee on the judiciary , to give a more exemplary outline of what transpired .
