mr. chairman , if you kill a police officer you are going to get death or life without parole . 
if you make any murder in the federal system you are looking at life . 
if you are talking about the impact of this bill , it is a 10-year mandatory minimum for second-offense fist fights . 
we have been asked where our compassion is for the victims . 
we have got mandatory minimums where you already know that it violates common sense , it wastes the taxpayers money , it fails to do anything about reducing crime . 
that is what the studies have shown . 
trying juveniles as adults we know increases crime . 
that is a good question . 
where is your compassion for the victims when you are actually increasing crime ? 
we know what works to reduce crime . 
we know what polls well , and what we need to do is have some compassion for common sense and actually enact those provisions that will reduce crime . 
we know that prevention and early intervention work . 
you know , you can make jokes about it ; but we know what works and we know what polls well . 
if we are going to show some compassion for our victims , we ought to do something to actually reduce crime .
