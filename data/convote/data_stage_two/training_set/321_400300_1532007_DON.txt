mr. chairman , let me thank the gentleman from ohio for striking the last word so you could raise this . 
let me simply say to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 , i fully agree with him about the value of the program . 
the president 's budget wanted to transfer it to this bill . 
the subcommittee did not pick up the money in this bill . 
in my view , it should have . 
but i would say that because it has not , there will be another opportunity next week to try to deal with this when the teasury-transportation bill comes to the floor . 
it would be disgraceful if the congress allowed this program to fall through the cracks because neither committee included the funding for it and if congress simply played alfonse and gaston on us between the two subcommittees .
