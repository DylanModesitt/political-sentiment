mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , let us do that . 
let us defeat this now and send it to a rule . 
the gentleman from california 's ( mr. doolittle ) xz4001130 idea of a substantive defense is maybe a tribute to the gallantry that he continues to exemplify long after it may have gone out of fashion . 
he says the reason this is a good idea is that the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 said so . 
i highly esteem my colleague from california with whom i disagree in this case . 
but the notion that her imprimatur is in itself a substantive defense of failing to follow the regular procedure does not meet the argument .
