mr. speaker , i thank chairman lewis for including in the supplemental the provision which is our wounded warrior bill . 
as our enemies adapt their war-fighting strategies , they change not just to kill our men and women overseas , but to maim and wound . 
roadside incendiary devices , rocket grenades , car bombs mean the loss of several arms and legs and eyes , blindness and paralysis . 
our men and woman coming home at walter reed army hospital and their families coming up to be with them so they can heal faster are incurring great debt . 
never mind that they try to transition back into society , those great wage earners , trying to find self-worth in the work . 
this bill includes the wounded warrior project . 
it says to our troops , we are going to provide you with supplemental disability insurance to help you transition back to being american citizens and thank you for your patriotism . 
i urge my colleagues to vote for this supplemental . 
do not allow these traumatic injuries to be the economic death sentence after our troops have survived the death bed overseas . 
vote for our wounded warriors .
