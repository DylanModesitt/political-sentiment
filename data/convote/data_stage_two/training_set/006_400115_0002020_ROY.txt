mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i would like to respond to my very good friend from maryland by saying that i may not be as eloquent today as i was when i was in the minority , but i continue to share my very strong commitment to ensure the integrity and the behavior of members of this institution . 
i also will say as my friend said , it is very clear that the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 , chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct , has made it clear that he is supportive of this package . 
i and my colleagues looked at these recommendations , all of which emerged from members and former members of the committee on standards of official conduct . 
i also believe that it is very possible for us to maintain the highest ethical standards and to continue to ensure , to now ensure that due process is entitled to members of this institution as they proceed with matters before that committee . 
so i believe that this package is one which should enjoy strong bipartisan support , because when it comes to matters of ethics it will address the concern and the protection of members of both the minority and the majority , as well as this institution as a whole . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
