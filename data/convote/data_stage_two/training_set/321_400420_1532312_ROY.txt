i thank the gentleman for yielding . 
i thank both the gentlemen for raising this issue . 
mr. chairman , this is a serious problem . 
there is a great deal of alarm about the uncovering of this information . 
it is a great disappointment . 
i thank the two gentlemen for bringing this up , even though it is not germane to this bill . 
the gentleman from texas ( mr. edwards ) xz4001180 and i have discussed this . 
we will be holding an oversight hearing on tuesday at 9 a.m . 
at which time members of the veterans administration , i believe we will also have people from defense health and possibly the office of management and budget , will come up and give us the straight scoop on what actually happened and who knew what and when .
