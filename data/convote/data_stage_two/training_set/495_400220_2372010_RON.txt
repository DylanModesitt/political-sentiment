mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , just to make a couple of gentle points , the effort has been , at least on the record , as not , i do not want to say fighting against injustice , but a record of fighting against justice , particularly in the case of the effort to free mumia abu-jamal . 
i think most of us know about that particular case . 
and i am concerned about a role model . 
i am concerned about young people a generation or two from now . 
when they go back by that post office in berkeley and look at the name on the post office , they are going to ask what were the principles that brought this about ? 
and i contend that those principles would be running contrary to american values . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
