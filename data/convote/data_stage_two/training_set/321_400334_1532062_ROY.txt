mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i thank the gentleman . 
we are very aware of the gentleman 's concerns . 
we have added a modest amount for the cancer institute . 
i have had many discussions with the director , dr . 
von eschenbach ; and what we are trying to do , and he is doing , the gentleman would be interested in , he is trying to coordinate the various research centers . 
there are many good institutions throughout the united states doing cancer research ; and because of the importance and the cost , we want to avoid duplication among these various institutions . 
so i think this program of trying to coordinate to ensure that they are not reinventing the wheel at each one of these places , because it is expensive , hopefully out of that effort there will be a more coordinated effort to target a cure for cancer because this would certainly be a great breakthrough .
