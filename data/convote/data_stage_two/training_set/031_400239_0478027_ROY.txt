mr. chairman , i attempt to visit my hospital regularly as well . 
and , indeed , visit the veterans who are now back at walter reed or bethesda . 
indeed , we all should be concerned about that priority . 
but , frankly , i am a bit incensed by the gentleman 's suggestion yesterday that would indicate that we do not give priority on a bipartisan basis to veterans . 
i would ask the gentleman to join me in a special mission . 
would the gentleman consider the mission ?
