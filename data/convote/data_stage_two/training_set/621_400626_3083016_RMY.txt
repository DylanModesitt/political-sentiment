mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentlewoman pointing out some of the specific provisions of h.r. 4297 that we will be dealing with tomorrow . 
i served in the georgia state legislature , and we worked for years to try to get tax deductibility for teachers for their out-of-pocket expenses . 
i do not know a single teacher that does not spend some of their own money to kind of fill the hole , to provide some of those items in the classroom , especially in the elementary grades , that make so much more valuable the education that our children receive . 
as i understand it , a no vote on h.r. 4297 means you do not want to allow for those deductions , you want to increase taxes on teachers if you vote against this bill ? 
is that accurate ?
