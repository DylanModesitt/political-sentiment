madam chairman , i agree with the gentleman from new hampshire . 
he and i have been working toward a solution to the contamination problem in new hampshire and across the nation . 
if he is not satisfied with the solution thus far , then i am not satisfied with it either , and i agree with him that more must and will be done . 
with the time that we will have to continue our already significant progress , i appreciate his commitment to reach out to other members with similar problems like his . 
committee staff and i stand ready to assist in every way and are fully committed to resolving the problem before the bill is presented to the president for enactment .
