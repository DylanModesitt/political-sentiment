mr. speaker , i did indeed say that there can be federal court review of due process , obviously . 
that has happened here . 
and the federal court said , `` not only has ms. schiavo 's case been given due process in state court , but few if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process. '' the difference in this bill is not that it is a review of state court , but it orders a de novo proceeding to ignore everything that happened in state court as if the state courts did not exist . 
that is unprecedented , that is contemptuous , that is different ; and that should not be done . 
she got the appellate review already . 
the appellate courts and federal court did not agree with the distinguished chairman . 
that is not an indication for a new bill .
