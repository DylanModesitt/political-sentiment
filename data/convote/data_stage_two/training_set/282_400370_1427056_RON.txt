i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
mr. chairman , i love henry hyde . 
i have awesome respect for tom lantos . 
i thank the gentleman from california for supporting the president in the war against iraq and to go into afghanistan . 
i thank him for being such a clear thinker along with the gentleman from illinois on so many issues . 
we are not part of the kyoto agreement . 
we are not part of the land mine agreement . 
we are not part of other treaties . 
we are not part of the icc , the international criminal court . 
i understand those things . 
we are in a war in afghanistan , a war in iraq , and we are telling the president of the united states and the secretary of state , forget it . 
we do n't care what you think . 
we 're going ahead . 
mandatory , nuclear option . 
it is going to happen even if the u.n . 
does most of what we ask . 
even if they do 80 percent of what we ask , it is still going to happen . 
mandatory . 
i can not believe when our men and women are fighting in iraq that we would move forward with legislation like this when we need to draw countries together . 
the problem is not all the reforms can physically happen , and some of them will not happen , and some in the u.n . 
might not even want them to happen . 
they are eager to have us withhold funds . 
they are eager to have more people hate the united states . 
the united states , the president , the secretary of state , they are working so hard , and they are making progress . 
we have a new manager , chris burnham , who is the under secretary running the whole management of the u.n . 
we are making progress . 
go with the hyde bill , but with the flexibility to let our president and our secretary of state have the ability to work with these countries to move them along and see progress .
