mr. speaker , i yield myself as much time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 599 will establish a house task force on ocean policy with the express purpose of developing recommendations and reporting to the house on the findings of the united states commission on ocean policy by june 2006 . 
this bipartisan task force will have members appointed by the speaker and minority leader who will focus on the final report of the united states commission on ocean policy entitled , `` an ocean blueprint for the 21st century. '' while the task force will have no legislative jurisdiction , it will put in place a mechanism to allow the house to look broadly at the question of caring for our oceans . 
the gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest ) xz4001490 is to be commended for his untiring commitment to the preservation of our ocean resources . 
we are able to bring this resolution forward today because of his good work and interest on this subject . 
it is important that this resolution be considered quickly , so that members may be appointed to the task force and can begin their work and produce a report by june 2006 . 
mr. speaker , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest ) xz4001490 and ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time that i have .
