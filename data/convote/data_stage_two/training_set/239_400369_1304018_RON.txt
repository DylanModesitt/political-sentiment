mr. speaker , so that no one listening to this debate is confused , this vote has nothing to do with dr-cafta , it has nothing to do with free trade , it is simply are we going to continue as part of the world trade organization . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr. thomas ) xz4004010 , the chairman of the ways and means committee .
