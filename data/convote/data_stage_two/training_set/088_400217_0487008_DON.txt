mr. chairman , i thank our ranking member for yielding me this time . 
this is a bad budget . 
the very safety net that we hoped to help american families is being shredded . 
the republican budget is wrong ; and the prescription is wrong for medicaid , over 52 million children , women , elderly , seniors , disabled individuals , 52 million in america . 
the largest health care program and the only health care program for many . 
the committee on energy and commerce has been instructed to cut $ 20 billion from the medicaid health care program for so many vulnerable citizens . 
medicaid pays for 70 percent of nursing home care in michigan . 
sixty-four percent of the costs are spent on the elderly and disabled . 
do we really want to hurt the least of these who have built this country ? 
this republican budget cuts medicaid even more than what the president sent to congress . 
we can do better . 
i just left a meeting with my governor in our michigan delegation , both democrats and republicans . 
unfortunately , the republicans wanted to blame our governor for medicaid , and they said cut medicaid back . 
when one is unemployed , when they have no health care , when jobs are being lost , unfortunately they need medicaid . 
and it is unfortunate that this budget does not restore medicaid , help the most vulnerable , and not ask for $ 20 billion cut for the elderly , for seniors , for the disabled . 
the budget is bad . 
it kills medicaid . 
we can do better .
