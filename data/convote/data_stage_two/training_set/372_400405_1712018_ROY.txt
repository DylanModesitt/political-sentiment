mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me this time and for his leadership . 
mr. speaker , we just heard about how antiworker this legislation is , as well as the other three bills ; but i would like to clarify a few things . 
this is not an antiworker agenda . 
what this does is simplify the rules that govern osha . 
now , there seems to be some thought that this legislation is going to make it more dangerous for workers or that it is antiworker , and that is really not the case . 
what we are trying to do is smoothly process the help that osha should be giving to employers for a safe workplace . 
there is no economic benefit for employers or those who keep and create jobs in america to want injured workers . 
quite the contrary . 
if a worker gets injured on the job , their insurance rates go up , there is loss of productivity , and quite often , small employers especially , hire family members . 
the last thing they would want to do is to go to the next family reunion and explain why their brother-in-law or their sister or some member of their family was injured on the job . 
what we would like to see is a cooperative effort between the osha folks and people who keep and create jobs in america , working together for a safe work environment . 
one of the ways you do that is you have the timely processing of cases so that you do not have a backlog . 
this particular bill would simply help that backlog be alleviated . 
this is a pro-worker piece of legislation . 
it does more to keep and create jobs in america than anything i have heard from the opposition both today and for the balance of this year . 
so i am very pleased to be supporting this piece of legislation . 
i want to make the point that it is a pro-worker agenda that we are moving forward here because it will help us keep and create jobs in america .
