mr. speaker , today i rise in support of the rule and this important piece of legislation . 
and i want to thank the gentleman from illinois ( chairman hyde ) for his leadership on this important issue , and it is an honor to serve with him on the committee on international relations . 
world leaders gathered in 1945 to implement a vision that began with president woodrow wilson 's league of nations , was conceived by president franklin roosevelt and brought into existence by harry truman , now known as the united nations . 
what the united nations has become today would surely break the hearts of these great men . 
more than just a group of countries working towards peace , the united nations represents the idea that each human being deserved a better existence . 
what happens at the united nations today does not represent these ideals . 
and until the united nations becomes the body envisioned by these giants of the past , until it becomes a place where the good of mankind is truly advanced , and not a place where the agendas of tyrants and dictators are protected , we should not continue to pay 25 percent of the united nations budget . 
there are those who believe that we should simply leave the u.n . 
and start over , and there are moments when i wonder if really there is no other option . 
there may be a day when this becomes inevitable , but now is not the time to cut and run . 
now is the time to hold the united nations accountable . 
it is important for the united states to remain engaged and a player on the world 's stage to enact these important reforms . 
this legislation has offered 39 important reforms with the teeth of tied to funding , which will return honor and integrity to what was once a distinguished body . 
i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation .
