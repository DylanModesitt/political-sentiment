mr. speaker , i claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit . 
mr. speaker , i urge a `` nay '' vote on the motion to recommit . 
i think this bill is fair , balanced , and good given the amount of money that is available . 
we do a lot of important things in education , health research , and in the department of labor . 
i urge all my colleagues to vote for the bill .
