mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i want to make some brief comments and then engage in some colloquy with the chairman . 
not to repeat anything that has been already said , but just to highlight why i can believe this is such an excellent work product , really three reasons : one , this chairman over the last 2 1/2 years has gone out into the country , both on the water side and on the energy side , gone into the depths of very complex places like our nuclear weapons complex , gone into our scientific research institutions , energy research , gone and seen demonstrations and the advancement of technology , and tried hard to understand what needs to be proposed . 
this chairman deserves tremendous credit . 
at no time in my 9 years on the committee on appropriations have i seen this kind of diligence that the gentleman from ohio ( chairman hobson ) has shown . 
secondly , it has been very fair and very bipartisan all along the way . 
third , this is one of the greatest assimilations of professional staff on both sides of the aisle , people with expertise and experience coming to the same subcommittee at the same time at a very important time . 
my hat is off to all of these individuals for their diligence . 
mr. chairman , if i may engage in a colloquy , i would like to say a few words on the importance of fielding a leadership-class computer for open science . 
for the past 2 years under your leadership , this subcommittee has provided additional funds to achieve this goal , and i thank you for this commitment . 
the oak ridge national laboratory and its partners were competitively selected to carry out this effort . 
with the additional funds provided by this bill , they will continue down that path .
