mr. speaker , i appreciate my friend 's comments , but just to correct the historical record , you may recall in the 1960s , president johnson did decide to pay for the war . 
there were some tax increases in order to support the ongoing military operation . 
it can be done . 
it should be done in this instance as well . 
we have been there for a couple years now . 
we are going to be there in future years . 
we need to start paying for this .
