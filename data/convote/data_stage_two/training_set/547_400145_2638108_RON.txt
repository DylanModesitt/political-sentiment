madam chairman , i yield myself 20 seconds . 
madam chairman , the assertion that this would be devastating to the market runs contrary to the facts before the committee . 
there was no evidence whatsoever presented to the committee to say that the system in place in states such as new jersey or california or elsewhere are in need of gses to come in to increase their conforming limits by 50 percent . 
there is already an additional market out there that allows for people to buy jumbo loans ; and there are a number of different variations , adjustable rate loans , that allow people who are in the upper brackets and making $ 200 , 000 to be able to afford and to buy these mortgages .
