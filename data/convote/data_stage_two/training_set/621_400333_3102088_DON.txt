mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i am so glad to hear my friend from florida talk about the economic growth that we can expect by making certain that the capital gains tax cut and the corporate dividend tax cut do not expire . 
what bewilders most people is that this does not expire until 2008 . 
nobody would be adversely affected until 2009 , and unless the gentleman does not believe he will be in the majority in the next few years , i do not see why he would have to say that people who are out of work , who are looking for work , who have lost their pension should believe that this tax cut that will continue to 2009 is going to help them . 
but maybe the gentleman from mississippi , who understands that not many of his constituents are going to understand this , might clarify some of the problems we have . 
mr. speaker , it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. taylor ) xz4003991 , who really knows what economic growth should be .
