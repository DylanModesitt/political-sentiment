mr. speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman from georgia and i have had a disagreement over this particular provision for several years . 
it is very clear in the bill , as i read it , not the way the gentleman from georgia ( mr. norwood ) xz4002960 reads it , and this is where the source of the disagreement comes in terms of how plans can choose groups of employees . 
under current erisa law , you are allowed to have different rates for different groups of employees as long as there is a reason other than the health status of that group to have a separate group . 
maybe you have a plant located in one part of the state , another plant in another part of the state . 
you could have two different rates at those two different plants , just like you can under most state laws and what you can under erisa . 
so i look forward to continuing to work with my friend from georgia to resolve our misunderstanding of this issue .
