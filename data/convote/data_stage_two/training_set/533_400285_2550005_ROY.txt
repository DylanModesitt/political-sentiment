i thank the gentleman . 
i asked about another issue , too , which is one that is so critically important for children . 
my colleague from georgia had mentioned before , during pregnancy , smoking being one of the risk factors . 
i believe that the sad statistic is that the pittsburgh region has some of the highest maternal smoking rates during pregnancy in the nation . 
my understanding is a lot of complications can come when you have a mother who smokes during pregnancy . 
certainly an important part of prenatal care for our children is understanding the importance of helping a mother to stop smoking during that time . 
i wonder if the gentleman can comment on some of the complications that might come for that mother and that baby not only during labor and delivery but the long-term effects for that child when the mother smokes during pregnancy .
