mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , normally i would not come to the floor to oppose a bill naming a post office in someone else 's district . 
i am confident i speak on behalf of some of the west coast members of congress , as well as the mainstream american values and certainly have no personal animosity towards the lady for whom this post office is named in this bill . 
however , there is a plethora of information on the record that sets her apart from , i will say , the most consistent of american values . 
and rather than read those into the record , mr. speaker , i just wish to voice my objection . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
