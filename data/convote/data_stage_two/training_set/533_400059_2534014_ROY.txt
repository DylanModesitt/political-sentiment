mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
the gentleman is talking about various kinds of supplements . 
he mentioned ephedra and other supplements to help people lose weight . 
that is a substantial distinction here . 
if a person buys a supplement and there has been misleading advertising or the manufacturer knows of adverse effects and does not communicate those , and if that constitutes a violation of law , a lawsuit is not prohibited by this legislation . 
this legislation is going the other way and saying you can not sue people if you get fat because you make wrong choices , as opposed to you have had some kind of injury or illness because of a misadvertised or otherwise inappropriate utilization of a supplement .
