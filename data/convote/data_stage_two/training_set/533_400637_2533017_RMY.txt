mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 554 , the personal responsibility in food consumption act . 
as a physician , and just as someone who can read the data , i can tell you that we have an epidemic of obesity in this country . 
obesity is a serious health problem , with very serious consequences . 
the most important step we can take to curb obesity is to impart to everyone in this country that obesity can be controlled when we take personal responsibility . 
a healthy and consistent diet , with an adequate amount of exercise , will work wonders . 
that 's the simple truth . 
we must get away from the notion there is anything remotely approaching a quick fix to obesity . 
maintaining a healthy lifestyle requires a life-long dedication to one 's own well-being . 
a lawsuit will not help anyone lose weight . 
allowing consumers to sue their local restaurant , to sue half the food industry , means that we are telling our citizens , `` it 's not your fault that you are obese. '' mr. chairman , that 's the wrong tack to take . 
i support this legislation because it sends the message to everyone in the united states , young and old , that taking control of your weight is your responsibility , and taking personal responsibility is the only way that weight control can be achieved . 
i commend the gentleman from florida , mr. keller , and chairman sensenbrenner , for their work on this legislation , and i urge passage of the bill .
