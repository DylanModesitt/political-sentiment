mr. chairman , for those of you who have read the prophet micah , i know that he was not speaking to the congressional budget office . 
he was speaking to the human heart , and that is the biggest difference between the policies that we have before us today . 
we believe that the individual should be free and should be allowed to determine their destiny . 
we do not believe that government should make decisions that people can make better for themselves . 
we do not believe that money equals compassion . 
we do not believe that money often equals success . 
money is not getting us results . 
and all that is offered on the other side is more money , more spending , higher taxes , more government , more bureaucracy , more regulation , more laws , more politicians making decisions that individuals and families and communities should be making for themselves my friends , government is growing out of control . 
what we are asking for in this budget is something that we should do every day in washington , and that is look at the results of the programs that we have put in place . 
government , we believe , should be there to help people who can not help themselves . 
and oftentimes , we have invented more government to try and take the place of families , take the place of neighbors , take the place of communities in order to solve problems . 
and too often we are not getting the results for all the extra money that we are spending . 
and too often , in this well of the house , we debate between percentages and dollar increases as if , if i spend $ 6 and you spend $ 7 you must care $ 1 more . 
and that is not the way our debate should evolve . 
our debate should be based on results . 
we need a results revolution in government . 
we need to look at the results we are getting from the programs we have put in place . 
if they just like last year , the house will lead . 
we led last year . 
we led when we got to a balanced budget in the late 1990s , and we will lead again today by passing what i believe is the strongest budget , the best blueprint , to get out of deficits , to make sure that we get results from the programs and the dollars that we are spending and make sure we get back on a path to freedom in this country . 
i urge adoption of this budget .
