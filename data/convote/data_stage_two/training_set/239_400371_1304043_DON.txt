mr. speaker , i will vote against this resolution because it is a little too radical for where i am now , but i am tempted to vote for it because of the failure of our current policies and the blindness of those who defend them . 
those who defend our current policies acknowledge that free trade puts pressure on countries to race to the bottom on environmental and labor standards so they can be the low-cost , high-value producer . 
but the real disconnect is between the theory of free trade and on-the-ground business reality . 
those who defend the wto live in a world of theory in which business and consumers will buy american goods if they are good values , subject only to the written transparent regulations and tariff laws of their country . 
this theory is true in the united states where our businesses and consumers are happy to buy . 
we have lowered our tariffs , we have lowered our regulations and barriers , and there has been an explosion of imports to the united states . 
but the theory is false as to china and many other nations . 
in those countries , their written laws are almost irrelevant ; and so we negotiate hard , we open our markets in return for a change of china 's written laws , and then we are surprised when changing those laws does nothing to open their markets and the average person in china buys less than 3 cents , i believe it is , of goods and services from america every day . 
why is this ? 
because their businesses are told orally , do not buy from america unless you get a co-production agreement , do not buy from america unless you get a disclosure of our technology and our manufacturing techniques . 
so when an airline in the united states goes to decide which airplane to buy , it does so on economic factors . 
when china buys , they demand that more and more production be shifted to china . 
no wonder we have this huge trade deficit and the dollar is certainly in peril .
