mr. speaker , i yield myself 10 seconds . 
i can appreciate the gentleman from california 's consistency . 
he was opposed to campaign finance reform . 
on the floor , he said he was opposed to any limit . 
he would just as soon have no limits at all on any campaign finance . 
he thinks corporations should give . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new hampshire ( mr. bass ) xz4000190 .
