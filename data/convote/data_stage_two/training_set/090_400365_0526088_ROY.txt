mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute to correct the record . 
there have been statements made on the actions of then-governor george w. bush of texas . 
i would like to correct the record on this . 
in 1997 , then-governor bush vetoed an advanced directives bill precisely because it would have given specific legal sanction to such involuntary denial of lifesaving treatment . 
an effort in the texas legislature to amend the bill to require treatment pending transfer to a health care provider willing to provide the lifesaving treatment had been defeated . 
with no legal protections at all under texas law , and ongoing programs in texas hospitals denying treatment with no opportunity to even seek transfer , pro-life groups entered into negotiations with medical groups that finally resulted in the bill that , one , formalized more protections for in-hospital review ; two , gave patients 10 days of treatment while seeking transfer ; and , three , authorized court proceedings to extend the 10 days for reasonable additional periods of time to accomplish transfer . 
that is what the governor signed . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr. cole ) xz4000770 .
