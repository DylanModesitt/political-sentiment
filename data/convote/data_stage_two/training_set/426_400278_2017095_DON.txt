mr. speaker , i submit a motion to recommit along with my colleagues on the committee on education and the workforce , the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. mccarthy ) xz4002570 , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. woolsey ) xz4004360 , and the gentlewoman from minnesota ( ms. mccollum ) xz4002590 . 
this motion shows exactly what the issue is about . 
it is about the minimum standard of health care protection for all americans , including those who work for small businesses . 
mr. speaker , all employees , including the employees of small employers , may need access to pregnancy , to well-child care , to cancer treatment , mental health treatment , or even diabetes treatment . 
we should not encourage insurers to offer bare-bones treatment that does not protect anyone . 
everyone gets sick at some point in their lives , and everyone will need access to a meaningful package of benefits . 
that is why i am offering this motion to recommit . 
mr. speaker , i yield to the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. mccarthy ) xz4002570 .
