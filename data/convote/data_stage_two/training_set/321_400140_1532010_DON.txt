mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin . 
i wonder if the gentleman from ohio could give us some guidance on what the chances are for the ultimate survival of this very important program which the president supports , and i believe is supported on the merits . 
could we get it in the bill next week ? 
or what is the prospects of this youth build program not dying because of kind of a shuffle here .
