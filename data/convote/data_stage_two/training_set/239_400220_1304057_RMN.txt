mr. speaker , i rise today to comment on h. j. res. 27 , which seeks to withdraw the approval of the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization . 
during my first term in congress , i witnessed firsthand the breakdown in affairs at the world trade organization 's trade negations in mexico . 
negotiations collapsed as delegates from many underdeveloped countries celebrated their perceived success as an increasingly powerful band of poor farming countries , known as g-21 , held strong to prevent talks from proceeding . 
it is important that each participating country have a voice in negotiations , but by banding together to divert trade talks , underdeveloped countries ultimately hurt themselves . 
no one in europe or the united states will starve to death because of their efforts , but the citizens in their own countries will be put at risk . 
what occurred puts the viability of the wto in question , but it also allows the u.s. to go forth with trade promotion authorization on its own . 
while i believe the wto needs reform , i do not want us to abandon our place at the table . 
if america were to pull out of the wto , we would lose the ability to influence the organization and its negotiations internally . 
our farmers and producers in iowa and across the country are some of the most efficient in the world and are capable of competing and winning in world markets , so long as they do not face unfair foreign government policies . 
the enforcement of a rules-based trading system through the world trade organization is our best opportunity to gain access to these markets for our nation 's farmers and rural communities . 
mr. speaker , i intend to vote against h. j. res. 27 because it is clear that our economic interests continue to benefit from engagement with trading partners .
