mr. chairman , i congratulate the chairman and the committee on government reform for reporting out this bill that is so important that this congress take action on and take action on now . 
of course we need to do this . 
of course we need to pass the real id act . 
because as the chairman just said , certainly all of us who board planes want to know that there is some integrity to our id system in this country and that terrorists are not boarding planes by the use of a state-issued identification card . 
this is not conjecture . 
this is what happened on 9/11 . 
this is what the 9/11 commission suggested that we take action on , and this is what we are here doing today . 
as the chairman suggested , i am proud to say that in 2003 virginia , under the leadership of former attorney general jerry kilgore , acted to close this dangerous loophole . 
the general assembly passed and the governor signed into law a provision which requires the minimum standard , which says that anyone applying for a license in virginia must have legal status in this country ; that they must have a visa ; and that the license that would be issued would coterminate with the termination or expiration of that visa . 
this is just common sense . 
why do we want terrorists to have a license issued by a state to go and board our airplanes and commandeer those airplanes into a building ? 
it is time for congress to act , to provide and mandate a minimum standard for states when they issue state ids , including driver 's licenses , to require that individuals who have that privilege be here in this country legally . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr. tom davis ) for his leadership on this , and i urge passage of the real id act .
