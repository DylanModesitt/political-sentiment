mr. speaker , in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita , our country has been made brutally aware that there in fact are two americas that exist in this country . 
recently released census data shows that in 2004 , 37 million people were living in poverty . 
in addition , this data shows that 1 in 6 children were living in poverty . 
yet despite the overwhelming evidence of growing poverty rates and recent images of evacuees unable to leave new orleans due to their economic situation , this congress is proposing drastic cuts to community service block grants funding . 
csbg gives funding to a vast array of programs , including senior citizen congregate meal sites , home delivered meals , transportation programs , job training programs , head start , energy crisis assistance , housing programs , education programs , and many other programs to address the needs of low-income families and individuals . 
the 50 percent cut to csbg in the continuing resolution would have a devastating effect on evacuees and on low-income individuals . 
at a time when our country has been severely impacted by natural disasters , it is extremely urgent that congress maintain csbg funding at its current level so that the delivery of much needed services to low-income people is not disrupted . 
we have a responsibility to ensure that all americans have an opportunity to share in america 's prosperity . 
it is irresponsible that we approve a continuing resolution that cuts funding for csbg by 50 percent below current funding levels when there is such an obvious need for the services that this funding provides .
