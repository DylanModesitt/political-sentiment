mr. speaker , if the gentleman would yield briefly , i just want to share a third-party validator that we have as we continue talking about welfare in the united states and what it is being spent on . 
this is by cal thomas , who writes a column . 
cal thomas , as most of you may know , is one of the conservative columnists in the country . 
in his column this week , he says , `` seventy-two percent of farm subsidy money goes to 10 percent of recipients , the richest farmers , partnerships , corporations , estates and other entities. '' cal thomas , third-party validator says too much money going to the big farmers , and this is a big welfare state . 
what is cal thomas ' advice to the 30-somethings and the house of representatives ? 
cal thomas says , `` here 's a suggestion : do n't start with the poor . 
start with the rich. '' cal thomas , one of the top conservatives in the country , is telling the republican congress , the republican senate and the republican president , start cutting the welfare programs for the richest people in this country . 
we have been pinned into a corner in this country where the people down in new orleans and those people who do not have and the middle class are somehow to be blamed for our huge deficits when 72 percent of ag money , ag subsidies are going to the top 10 percent of the farmers .
