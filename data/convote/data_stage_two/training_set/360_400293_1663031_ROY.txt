mr. speaker , i yield myself the time remaining . 
mr. speaker , i want to thank the gentlewoman from michigan for standing up tonight for this resolution , standing up for the american people . 
i want to thank the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) for this resolution and also the gentleman from ohio ( chairman oxley ) for expediting this , also being a cosponsor , but expediting this to the floor . 
mr. speaker , national security has to include economic security . 
this is an important resolution . 
never in a million years would china let us do this type of deal over there , and do not fool yourselves about that . 
this deal is not good for america . 
it is not good for american workers . 
as we near our birthday of this country , let us not give a gift to the chinese government . 
let us give a gift to the american people and support this important resolution .
