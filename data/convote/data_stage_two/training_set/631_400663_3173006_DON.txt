mr. speaker , strange things happen around this place when we are getting ready for recess . 
legislation just seems to come out of the woodwork sometimes , like the resolution on the suspension calendar today . 
the bill before us today would spend $ 400 , 000 of taxpayer money to establish a house task force on ocean policy . 
quite simply , it is duplicative and wasteful . 
there is already a standing house committee to deal with ocean policy that professional staff already have in place . 
the rules committee has not met to consider this resolution . 
in fact , no action , at least none that i am aware of , has been taken beyond the simple introduction of this measure . 
this resolution just appeared on the schedule at the last minute with no explanation , no details , and no reason for its urgency . 
so i am a bit puzzled about why this task force is needed at all . 
generally , task forces are created when there is an issue that crosses the jurisdictional lines of several different committees , all of whom claim primary jurisdiction . 
in that circumstance , there may well be a need to coordinate efforts in an efficient manner . 
however , in this case , the primary issues fall within the jurisdiction of the resources committee . 
in fact , there is a subcommittee on fisheries and oceans chaired by the gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest ) xz4001490 . 
that is where this issue belongs . 
let me be clear : our nation 's ocean policy is a worthy project , but i believe that this issue should be taken up by the resources committee . 
that is where the expertise is . 
i hope that the resolution 's sponsors and other members speaking here today will shed some light on the need to move so quickly on this measure . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my time be controlled by the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. pallone ) xz4003080 .
