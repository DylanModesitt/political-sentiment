mr. chairman , that is what i think of the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 . 
mr. chairman , i just want to point out that substantial compliance is accorded to the secretary of state , so if 38 of the 39 are complied with , the 39th could have been substantially complied with and suffice . 
mr. chairman , i yield the remaining time to the gentleman from missouri ( mr. blunt ) xz4000340 .
