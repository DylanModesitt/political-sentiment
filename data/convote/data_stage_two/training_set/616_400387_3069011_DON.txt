mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr. brown ) xz4000501 , a colleague nominated for the nobel prize in literature for his best selling book `` the myth of free trade , '' also an author who understands that the king of bahrain was not elected . 
i do not care what kind of a democracy it is , kings do not get elected . 
and if my good friend from wisconsin had suggested that we could take our troops out of iraq immediately and substitute this cockamamie free trade agreement , i would join with him in that , but i am not sure that that is what he thought .
