mr. speaker , over half of americans are invested in the stock market . 
they do have some form of dividend or capital gains and it is really their nest egg . 
those are the 401 ( k ) plans to help them in their retirement years . 
that is money that is put away for education for their children , and yet our democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to tax away that dream . 
they want to tax away that nest egg by passing a huge tax increase tomorrow . 
that is over half of americans in just this one provision . 
just this one provision would see a huge tax increase right before christmas if we do not defeat this democrat tax increase tomorrow .
