mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to the labor , health and human services and education appropriations conference report before us . 
one month ago , the house of representatives voted this bill down because it failed to address the priorities of the american people . 
i am disappointed that the conferees have sent it back to us without significant changes . 
before we voted on this bill in november , my constituents told me what was important to them . 
rhode islanders , like all americans , are concerned about health care and the economy . 
i believe the public sentiment on these issues accounted for the failure of this bill last month . 
with more than 45 million uninsured americans and 7.4 million unemployed americans , now is not the time to cut health professions training grants by 51 percent or take $ 229 million away from the unemployment insurance and service programs . 
yet , this second conference agreement once again proposes to do just that . 
the consequences of ignoring these societal problems are far-reaching . 
major cutbacks in the areas of education and health care will have a tremendous economic impact on our nation . 
however , the republican leadership set the stage for cuts in these critical programs . 
when congress passed h. con . 
res. 95 , the budget conference report , they made it clear that tax cuts for the wealthy will continue to be paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend on . 
last month , i outlined my concerns about specific aspects of this bill -- cuts for no child left behind , an already underfunded mandate ; the failure to increase the maximum pell grant as included in the original house bill ; and providing insufficient funding for the national institutes of health , which would decrease the number of federal research grants for the second year in a row . 
as these concerns have not been addressed in the second conference report , i urge my colleagues to reject h.r. 3010 -- again .
