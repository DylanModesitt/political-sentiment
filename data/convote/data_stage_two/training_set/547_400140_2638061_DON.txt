mr. chairman , i first yield myself 1 minute to say i do not think it is a fair characterization of the low-income housing activities of the catholic church or other organizations that they are trying to back up the truck to the treasury . 
in the first place , there is no debate that every penny in the affordable housing fund goes for affordable housing . 
the question is , what do you have to give up as a choice of doing the affordable housing . 
every faith organization in america , every protestant denomination , every branch of judaism , and the roman catholic church says we do housing , and the gentleman is right . 
they could simply refuse to take any money from this and go forward , because they are not eligible for money from this . 
why do that ? 
why say to the faith-based organization , whatever happened to your belief in the importance of helping faith-based organizations ? 
is it over already , that romance ? 
because that is what we just want to change . 
all we want is to allow our religious organizations in part to be able to participate without stopping their voter registration and other activity . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. kanjorski ) xz4002100 .
