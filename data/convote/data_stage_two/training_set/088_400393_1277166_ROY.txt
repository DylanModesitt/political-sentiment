mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , let me quickly respond to some of the information that has been put out there . 
first of all , on the cost end of it , cbo said already this is a cost-neutral proposition . 
in fact , it is my contention that it will give the usda extra resources to do the job of protecting the american food chain . 
secondly , we talked about the failure of a lack of a hearing . 
we looked for a hearing for 2 years . 
that necessitated bringing this legislation . 
finally , if we are simply going to get into a debate over which organizations support it , there are vastly more organizations , some of the most preeminent experts in the horse industry who support this legislation , including congress 's top veterinarian , senator ensign , who is introducing a counterpart bill in the senate . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from south carolina ( mr. spratt ) xz4003860 .
