madam chairman , the best way that i can characterize this bill is that it is a jurassic park bill in that it is about dinosaurs , of dinosaurs , and in a sense by dinosaurs . 
it depends on the hope that somehow dead dinosaurs will appear underneath the continent of the united states where they just do not exist . 
we consume 25 percent of the oil ; we have only 3 percent of the world 's oil reserves . 
if you drill in mt . 
ranier national park , the arctic and yosemite , the oil is not there ; the dead dinosaurs decided to die somewhere else . 
this is a doomed policy of searching for dead dinosaurs . 
and it is a dinosaur-like philosophy that we should decide to subsidize technology being developed in the late 1800s in 2005 . 
we should be giving these subsidies to the nascent wind , solar , wave power , energy-efficient cars so we can build energy-efficient cars here rather than in japan . 
you do not give mother 's milk to a 65-year-old person ; you give it to the nascent infant industries that need it . 
that is not what happened to this bill , where 94 percent of the subsidy goes to an industry , the most profitable in american history ; one company had $ 8 billion profit in the third quarter last year on your $ 55 a barrel oil . 
that is what is going on in this bill . 
what we should be doing is hearing lessons from our successful past , where we showed where we increase the efficiency of our cars ; that is an energy future . 
we need the new apollo energy plan , a visionary high-tech plan , not a dinosaur-like plan .
