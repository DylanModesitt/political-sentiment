mr. speaker , i thank my colleague on the committee on rules . 
i rise in full support of the rule and the underlying bill . 
i remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , who keep saying , we are not given enough time and we are rushing all of these complicated issues that we have not discussed , but these provisions i remind my colleagues , they were in the original bill that we passed on the house side , the intel bill . 
unfortunately , they were taken out by the senate conferees . 
we are asking to do the things that the 9/11 commission , all 10 of them , in their unanimous report , asked us to do . 
listen to this : `` if terrorist travel options are reduced , they may be forced to rely on means of interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents which are more readily detectable. '' the 9/11 commission report , page 65 , `` all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of united states identification document , some by fraud. '' acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights , renting cars , and other necessary activities . 
the 9/11 commission report , page 390 , `` my daughter worked at the republican convention this summer . 
i worried about her . 
unbeknownst to me , during the convention an illegal alien from pakistan was picked up and arrested for attempting to bomb the herald square subway station . 
she rode on that subway every day going back and forth to work. '' he was quoted as saying , `` i want at least 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 to die in a single day. '' and that alien had applied for asylum . 
mr. speaker , these are sensible provisions . 
we are completing the work of the intel bill , and i support it . 
we need to get it done and we need bipartisan support .
