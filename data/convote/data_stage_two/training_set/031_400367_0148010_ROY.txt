mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , the gentlewoman from texas has politely articulated something that i believe is misguided and inappropriate . 
the congressional budget office is a professional organization that assists the united states congress in knowing in a nonpartisan way those impacts of the laws that we pass , and i have respectfully made sure that the gentlewoman had a copy and had been advised that before she came to the floor , evidently , the minority was in possession of this new document of 2005 . 
and the committee on rules , in a meeting that we had yesterday where we considered this legislation , had to understand the implications or some of the implications as it related to this act , and we rely upon the current information that has come from the congressional budget office . 
so i am very disappointed that my colleague has chosen to think that we have placed pressure upon this professional organization , that we have fudged the numbers ; and i would say to the gentlewoman from texas that that , i believe , is not only an unfair accusation to this member but , more specifically , to the congressional budget office , which i believe is a professional organization , delivers a product that they put their name on and makes available to all who might read it . 
so i respectfully disagree with the gentlewoman , do not accept the characterization that she has given to this member or to the congressional budget office , and would hope that the gentlewoman would find the time perhaps later in the day to bring this issue up upon full scrutiny of the documentation to recognize that , in fact , the professional conduct of the congressional budget office was correct in their assertion . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
