mr. chairman , when we shut our doors to the world we shut the door of democracy . 
president bush wants the united states to be a leader in promoting freedom around the world , but we fail at home when we deny freedoms to those who desire the american dream . 
h.r. 418 fails to reform our system . 
instead , it weakens our democracy . 
if you vote for this bill you are saying we do n't care if you have been persecuted because of your religion or beaten because of your gender . 
stay in your own country . 
you are not entitled to our freedoms . 
if you vote for this legislation you are saying that the united states does n't care about federal or state laws as long as it means being able to close our border . 
who cares if building a wall on our border endangers our environment ? 
out of 2 , 000 plus miles along our border with mexico , you are saying that finishing 3 miles of that fenced area in southern california is so important that we should throw out the principles of our democracy and let one man have the power to waive any laws that he wants without any oversight . 
are you sure that this is a democratic country ? 
mr. chairman , shutting out people around the world from our democracy and throwing away the ideals of freedom that we hold so dear is no to way to be an example for the world . 
we need immigration reform but this legislation is not the right answer . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation .
