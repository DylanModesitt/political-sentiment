reclaiming my time , i think we both agree on that . 
the gentleman from maryland ( mr. cardin ) xz4000640 wanted to say something , but i wanted to say you were right on the process . 
i was incorrect on the process . 
it was a separate vote on a separate package , and you are right that i and the gentleman from maryland ( mr. cardin ) xz4000640 and others voted against it . 
it was not on these provisions as you know because a change was made , not in a partisan sense , according to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. cardin ) xz4000640 . 
mr. speaker , i yield to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. cardin ) xz4000640 to explain his perception and recollection of the process .
