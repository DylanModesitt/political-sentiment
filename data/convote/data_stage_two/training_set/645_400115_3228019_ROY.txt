will the gentleman yield ? 
i have yielded 2 minutes to the gentleman . 
i think he still has time . 
i just would like to say that i believe that the resolution that has been brought forward is one which recognizes the directive , the call from the president of iraq . 
it recognizes the sense of the men and women in uniform who are on the ground there . 
and i believe that an overwhelming majority , and i will say to my friend , there may be some republicans who choose to vote against this measure . 
i do n't know that every republican is going to vote in support of this resolution , but this resolution underscores the importance of victory in iraq .
