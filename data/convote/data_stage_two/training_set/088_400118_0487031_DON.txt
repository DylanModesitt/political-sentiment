mr. chairman , my colleague , the gentleman from indiana ( mr. buyer ) xz4000560 , may want to hide behind a fig leaf of charging demagoguery , but let us review the facts he did not refute . 
fact number one , this budget will cut veterans pensions compensation and education benefits by nearly $ 800 million . 
fact number two , over 5 years it will cut veterans health care by nearly $ 14 billion . 
fact number three , in this same budget someone making a million dollars a year in dividend income will get to keep every penny of his $ 220 , 000 tax break . 
they may call it demagoguery . 
i think america 's veterans will call it wrong , wrong what they are doing to our service men , women and our veterans .
