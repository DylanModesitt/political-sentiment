mr. speaker , the vast education cuts brought before us today in this conference agreement and additionally in the budget reconciliation package that we may see today , are telling signs of the priorities of this congress . 
these cuts demonstrate , far better than words ever could , that education is not a priority for this house . 
this conference agreement provides a mere $ 11 million increase for head start , a pivotal program for preschool-aged children in low-income families across the nation . 
at current funding levels , head start serves approximately half of the children eligible for its services , a wholly inadequate proportion . 
this program , which has repeatedly been found to dramatically improve the academic performance of students deserves much more than an $ 11 million increase . 
the conference agreement cuts school improvement funding by 6 percent and flat funds teacher quality grants . 
these grants , which are used to recruit qualified teachers and support teacher development , are critically important to efforts to improve student achievement . 
rather than strengthening the pell grant program and increasing access to higher education for low-income students , the conference agreement maintains the current maximum pell grant of $ 4 , 050 . 
at this level , the maximum pell grant only covers 39 percent of tuition at the average four-year public college , making a mockery of its status as the foundation of student aid for the poorest students . 
what are our priorities ? 
the votes members cast today on this conference agreement and the budget reconciliation later today , will show their priorities . 
do we place more value on tax cuts for the wealthy or the education of our students ? 
i urge my colleagues to join me in prioritizing students ' well-being and vote no on this conference report and on the budget reconciliation package .
