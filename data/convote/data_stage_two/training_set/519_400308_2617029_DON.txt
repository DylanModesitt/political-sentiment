mr. speaker , the budget bill that they want us to vote on , the one we were supposed to vote on last week , cuts funding for levees again , not necessarily the one in new orleans , but other levees in louisiana . 
this is part of the funding cuts . 
they want to cut levee construction now . 
this is not the same one that fell in new orleans .
