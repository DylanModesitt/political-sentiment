mr. speaker , this bill does not require the states to do anything or not do anything . 
it has been very clear from the beginning of the debate on this legislation . 
what the bill does is it says that a driver 's license has to meet certain standards if it is to be acceptable for federal id purposes , such as getting on an airplane . 
what the motion to recommit does is force the states to do something , or not do something ; and that goes directly against the notion of federalism that is contained in this bill and which was drafted by the committee on government reform . 
the first vote that we had yesterday on this legislation was on whether we should waive the law relative to unfunded mandates . 
the vote on that was 228 `` aye '' to 191 `` no. '' the author of this motion to recommit , as well as the 190 who joined him in saying that we should not waive the unfunded mandate law , is now asking the states to have another unfunded mandate . 
i would urge all of the 191 who voted `` no '' on the jackson-lee objection to consideration of the rule to bring this up to join me in voting `` no '' on this motion to recommit , together with the 228 who voted the right way yesterday . 
vote `` no '' on the motion to recommit ; vote `` aye '' on passage . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time .
