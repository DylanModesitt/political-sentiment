mr. speaker , it is unfortunate that while we are in the midst of a healthcare crisis for the uninsured , for small businesses , and for practitioners , congress is recycling the same flawed legislation . 
the proposal would allow association health plans to bypass the state solvency framework requirements , leaving the consumers at a significant risk . 
the reason that over 1 , 350 business , labor , and community organizations oppose h.r. 525 -- including organizations such as the national governors association , 41 attorneys general , the national association of insurance commissioners , blue cross/blue shield , national small business united and 69 local chambers of commerce -- is because it not only misses the point , it will make things worse . 
the bill would undermine our efforts to provide essential services to everyone by providing incentives to insure only the healthiest and wealthiest , leaving the vast majority of over 1/2 million uninsured oregonians and 45 million uninsured americans behind . 
even worse , the adverse selection process will mean that the insurance pool will be narrower and sicker , resulting in more expensive insurance for most families . 
furthermore , the congressional budget office estimates that 8 million individuals who currently have health coverage will be switched to a lower benefit plan . 
consumers may be denied the proper screening , procedures and treatment they deserve . 
these are critical issues for taxpayers and businesses alike . 
i will continue to work with the healthcare and business community to produce the type of process , discussion and legislation americans critically deserve .
