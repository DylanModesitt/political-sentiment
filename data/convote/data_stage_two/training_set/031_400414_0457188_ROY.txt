mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i thank my coauthors , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. kind ) xz4002180 and the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs. myrick ) xz4002880 . 
i want to say it is not an easy task taking on the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 . 
i too would like to say i am voting for final passage of the supplemental . 
it is important that we have adequate resources for all of our troops . 
i have been to iraq twice . 
i have been to the current embassy in baghdad twice as well . 
i have seen the improvements . 
we have spent something like $ 100 million already trying to make that facility safe . 
it is within the green zone . 
this new embassy where they want to build is just down the river . 
frankly , i would have preferred to see it go where camp victory is . 
i asked that question , in fact , yesterday . 
i was not very pleased with the answer that i got , but maybe in a few more months we will get it right and put it someplace that would be truly safe for all of our folks that are there . 
at the end of the day , those are the questions that all of us should be asking . 
whether it be in an authorization bill that came through this congress the last year or in the omnibus bill or in the president 's budget for fiscal year 2006 , this bill no matter what train track it is on will not get to the president until may . 
we ought to take the time to do this right , to ask the right questions and to make sure that all of our people , whether they work for the state department or whether they work for the armed services , have the right resources ; but it ought to go the regular order . 
that is the way this house ought to operate . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
