mr. speaker , we have heard it over and over again today on the floor . 
too many working americans have a job , but are uninsured because their employers can not afford to purchase quality health insurance benefits for their workers . 
this bill addresses the two most important issues in the health care reform debate : cost and access . 
h.r. 525 would , one , increase small businesses ' bargaining power with health care providers ; two , give them much-needed freedom from costly state-mandated benefit packages ; and , three , lower their overhead costs by as much as 30 percent . 
our small businesses are denied the ability to purchase health coverage with the benefits large multistate companies and unions have enjoyed for decades . 
this bill fixes that problem . 
by pooling their resources , increasing their bargaining power , ahps will help small businesses reduce their health insurance costs . 
as the members have heard me say before , if it is good enough for wall street , it is good enough for main street . 
small businesses in most states are stuck with disproportionately higher costs because they have to choose from fewer than five providers . 
so ahps offer them a new option to choose from . 
most importantly , ahps will expand access to quality health care for the people for whom it is currently out of reach : uninsured working families . 
this bill has had unwavering support in the house for nearly a decade now . 
the other body is taking a serious look at the legislation this year , and it is a priority in the president 's health care agenda . 
i look forward to working with our colleagues from the other body to make this bill law this year . 
the problem is getting worse every day . 
small businesses need our help now . 
let us vote `` yes '' on h.r. 525 .
