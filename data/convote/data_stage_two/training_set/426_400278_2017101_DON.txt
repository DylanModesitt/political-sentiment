mr. speaker , i would hope that people would support this motion to recommit . 
this is fundamental and basic . 
it is about whether or not people will have coverage that works for them when they or a member of their family becomes sick . 
cbo has looked at this legislation three times , and three times they have determined that almost 8 million people who today have health care coverage that is good coverage , they will be stripped of that coverage and put into these ahps . 
in fact , they expect that 90 percent of the new enrollees will be people who come out of better plans who will lose that coverage that people have fought hard for in almost every state in this union , to have those kinds of health care protections that our three colleagues just spoke about in support of this motion to recommit . 
i would urge the house to support the motion to recommit and reject this legislation that is harmful to the health care coverage of millions of americans and their families .
