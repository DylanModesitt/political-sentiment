mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me . 
i would just like to make the point this does not turn over any court decisions . 
united has yet to file a business plan with the creditors committee . 
the fact of the matter is this is the only opportunity we are going to have to have them go back and negotiate and try to use private systems to solve this problem before they come to the taxpayers . 
so this does not tamper with any court decisions or with the ability of united to go forward .
