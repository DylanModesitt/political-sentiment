mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of the conference report to fund urgent supplemental requirements for the military . 
for the state department , we have included just over $ 2 billion , a reduction of $ 199 million from the president 's request . 
the bill includes the necessary funds to maintain our diplomatic presence in iraq and afghanistan , and for allowing our personnel to carry out their duties in the safest and most secure manner . 
iraq and afghanistan are the front lines of our foreign policy . 
this conference report provides the necessary resources for operations , logistics , and security in those dangerous , but critically important , parts of the world . 
there is also $ 592 million to allow state to move quickly to build a secure compound in baghdad and , as the gentleman from missouri ( mr. blunt ) xz4000340 said , these facilities are not secure now , and they are needed . 
this money will result in the completion of a secure living and working compound facility within 24 months . 
the $ 680 million , $ 100 million below the president 's request , pays for the u.s. share of ongoing peacekeeping missions , including a new mission for sudan , where it is absolutely critical , now that there is a north-south peace . 
and , by sending this mission there , hopefully , it will bring peace to darfur . 
the conference report also includes $ 241.6 million for domestic appropriations to support the war on terror , including fbi counterterrorism efforts and , for dea , a counternarcotics program in afghanistan . 
finally , it includes $ 17.2 million to jump-start the improvement of the united states tsunami warning capabilities on both coasts . 
the conference report before us provides funding for important security measures for our diplomatic personnel , for our ongoing state department and justice department commitments , and i strongly urge support of the conference report .
