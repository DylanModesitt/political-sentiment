madam speaker , i thank the gentleman from colorado for the explanation of this . 
i think it is so important for us to keep this in perspective . 
we are talking about 2 , 000 acres when we talk about anwr , and it is in many hundreds of thousands of acres . 
it is like putting a quarter on the dining room table , that is the relationship of that space . 
so i thank the gentleman from colorado for his work on the issue . 
the gentleman from idaho , who is a member and a leader on the committee on energy and commerce , has certainly worked on some of the issues dealing with refineries and permitting . 
we have not had a new refinery built in the country in 30 years , madam speaker . 
and as i mentioned earlier , the bill addresses our needs for today and looks toward the future . 
obviously , there are some in this body who would like for us to flip a switch and tomorrow start driving hydrogen fuel cell cars and to start doing things we would all love to see happen , to look at more alternative sources . 
but we have to think about where our economy is today and meeting those needs for oil and gas today while at the same time we are planning for the future . 
the gentleman from idaho ( mr. otter ) xz4003050 is going to talk with us for a few moments about refineries and permitting and some of the points that are covered that address the needs of today and of our economy today . 
so i thank the gentleman for joining us and i yield to him .
