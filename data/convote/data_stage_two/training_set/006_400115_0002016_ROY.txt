mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
let me say after having heard from two of my committee on rules colleagues that i anxiously look forward to working with them in a bipartisan way to try to proceed with the deliberations in consideration of measures of this house . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from colorado ( mr. hefley ) xz4001740 , the distinguished chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct .
