mr. speaker , i make a point of order . 
mr. speaker , pursuant to section 426 on the congressional budget act of 1974 , i make a point of order against consideration of the rule , h. res. 219 . 
page 1 , line 7 , through page 2 , line 1 , of h. res. 219 states , `` all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. '' the rule makes in order h.r. 6 , the energy policy act of 2005 , which contains a large unfunded mandate on state and local governments in violation of section 425 of the budget act . 
section 426 of the budget act specifically states that the committee on rules may not waive section 425 , and therefore this rule violates section 426 .
