mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
my colleague from toledo clearly laid out what was a tragedy in her community with regard to the four gentlemen who lost their lives in this accident . 
this accident continues to be under review by osha . 
we hope that osha will get to the bottom of what did happen , and , more importantly , who was responsible . 
i do not think it serves those families , the community or any of us to point fingers and to lay blame without facts . 
to my knowledge at this point , this particular case is still under investigation . 
there are still lots of details to be gleaned . 
and when this picture becomes clearer , we can then take a course of action that in fact may be appropriate . 
but i am waiting for this review and this investigation to continue . 
but the point here is that the bill that we are debating would actually , i think , assist in making the determination about who is guilty , because by making it clear that the review commission should hear these cases and can adjudicate these cases , you can make a determination about who was right and who was wrong by an independent commission , not by osha itself . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. norwood ) xz4002960 .
