mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i rise in support of the resolution . 
the house went on record earlier today in a strong , bipartisan way , to support that we would , first of all , make sure that cfius , which is the committee on investments in the united states chaired by the secretary of the treasury snow , that we go on record making sure that we not spend money at this time for a chinese company that is communist-owned by the communist government to take over our ninth largest oil company . 
the congress has spoken , and we are happy that we did so in a loud , strong voice . 
the sense of the congress resolution before us is one that we also support . 
general motors is losing technology to china , and it is costing the company $ 12 billion a year . 
intellectual property rights are not being protected , and china has been abusing those rights . 
we must protect american business , and we must do what is necessary . 
so , i am proud of the congress and the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 for introducing this resolution that we also further state our strong support for not allowing the sale to go through . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
