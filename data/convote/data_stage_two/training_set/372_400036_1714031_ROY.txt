mr. speaker , i congratulate the gentleman from georgia ( mr. norwood ) xz4002960 who has spent a lot of years trying to make osha work better for those in the workplace and those who employ them in the workplace . 
he has done a great job in bringing these four bills out of the subcommittee and to the floor today . 
mr. speaker , we are here today to help promote a climate of cooperation between osha and employers . 
the focus is on improving workplace safety . 
in so doing , we have the opportunity to enhance business competitiveness and further job creation . 
now these bills are important and here is why . 
no small business should be penalized for missing a deadline because of an honest mistake . 
no small business should have to wait 8 years to have their case reviewed by the occupational safety and health review commission simply because it can not get a quorum . 
thirdly , no small business wants to go up against an osha that is the prosecutor , judge and jury all in one . 
lastly , no small business should be required to spend years and significant money trying to recover attorneys ' fees after defending itself against a meritless enforcement action by osha . 
these osha reform bills can make a real difference in the lives of small businesses that face fierce competition at home and abroad . 
we truly do believe that these bills will help the effectiveness of osha and help improve the workplace safety for millions of american workers . 
i encourage all of my colleagues to support all four bills .
