mr. speaker , i am wondering , based on that argument , in the interest of efficiency , whether we might not substitute chat rooms for the floor of the house , and if being on the web site is a satisfactory way to bring a bill out . 
maybe if we had chat rooms or instant messaging , we could probably save a lot more . 
i would urge the majority , since this traditional kind of old-fashioned type of democracy does not seem to have much appeal , to go right ahead , might even save a little more money , by cutting back on what thomas jefferson or abe lincoln or one of those people might have thought was an appropriate way to conduct the business of democracy .
