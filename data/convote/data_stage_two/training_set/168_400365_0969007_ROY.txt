madam chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
madam chairman , i deeply respect the arguments that have been advanced by the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 . 
he put forth his proposal in committee , and it was defeated on a rollcall vote of 3 ayes to 22 noes . 
so the schiff proposal did not even carry a majority of the democratic members in the committee , let alone the republican members . 
madam chairman , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. wolf ) xz4004350 , who is also a sponsor of this bill .
