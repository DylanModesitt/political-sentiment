mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time . 
i could well envision a procedure that would require the epa to coordinate in a consultative process with the department of energy to resolve environmental issues , but the crafters of this bill have i would say knowing the gentleman from texas not intentionally but unintentionally overreached . 
they extend this authority for the secretary of department of energy to overturn a range of federal laws . 
the corps of engineers regulates activities that would have adverse effect on navigable waters of the united states . 
private parties could locate wharves , docks , other structures in the water that would obstruct commerce ; but the corps of engineers has permitting authority that says , no , you can not do that . 
with this language , the secretary of energy could throw out a century of regulatory authority , for example , in the case where a refinery has been denied a permit to build a structure in a navigable waterway . 
the applicant would appeal to the secretary of energy who would just simply overturn the corps . 
refineries often are not located near navigable waterways to facilitate barge traffic . 
if the corps said , no , you are going to do something that is going to obstruct navigation , the secretary of energy could overturn the corps . 
i do not think that is intended , and this authority goes even further to faa and other agencies under the jurisdiction of our committee . 
it should be defeated .
