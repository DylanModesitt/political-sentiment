mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i simply again thank the chairman for his leadership , for being a gentleman , and for being a friend ; and i recommend the legislation to my colleagues . 
mr. chairman , i have no further requests for time , and i yield back the balance of my time .
