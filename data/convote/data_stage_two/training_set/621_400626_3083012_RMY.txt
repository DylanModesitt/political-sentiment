if the gentlewoman will yield , i want to get this straight , because i think it is incredibly important for the american people to understand what is going to happen this week in the house . 
as i heard the gentlewoman say , if an individual in this chamber votes `` no '' on h.r. 4297 , that means that they want to see the american people not be able to deduct sales tax , state and local sales tax ?
