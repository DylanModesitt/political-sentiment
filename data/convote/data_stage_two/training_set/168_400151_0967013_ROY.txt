mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
the gentleman from virginia who just spoke is a brilliant lawyer , and i know he is not missing any points ; but i want to say it is very important that the rest of our colleagues understand , we know that all of these crimes mentioned here today are illegal . 
but the point is , this bill addresses the dismantling of the systems that support gangs , and i think it is very important that we keep that in mind . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr. reichert ) xz4006600 , 8 years king county sheriff and 30 years as a police officer .
