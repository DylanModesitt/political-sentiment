madam chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me . 
i agree with the gentleman that invasive species pose a threat to the marine environment , and we do provide funds in the bill reported by the committee to address the invasive species act . 
we have also provided other invasive species funds to stop that in areas of timber and things coming in from imports . 
for instance , the hemlock wooly adelgid is one of the invasive species that are threatening one of our species and may wipe it out in plant area . 
but the gentleman is right , and i will work with him to see if we can increase funding in this area in the conference report . 
i note there are some small increases included in the bill for invasive species efforts by the fish and wildlife service also . 
so we will try to work with him to increase his request .
