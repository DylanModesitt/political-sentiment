mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this additional time , and i am surprised that such an able lawyer would be unwilling to engage in a debate on his time , but i will take 30 seconds simply to rebut what the gentleman said . 
in every one of those cases on the wheel of rhetoric that the gentleman put up , those that were found guilty , those who were found to be responsible , those who were found to be culpable of doing harmful things to our community admitted it , paid a fine , paid a penalty , that was approved by a judge , and that is the fact ; that the gentleman took cases of people who admitted with their actions there was wrongdoing involved . 
and if they had not been caught by this system , i ask the gentleman , what system would they be caught by ?
