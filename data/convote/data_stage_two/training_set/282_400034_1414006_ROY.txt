mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support and appreciation really of both of our leaders on this bill , the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 , and i am particularly pleased to see this bill named in appreciation and recognition of the great leadership of our committee on international relations chairman , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 . 
i think we all know on both sides of the aisle that the united nations has not lived up to its expectations . 
it unfortunately has come way too close to mirroring the ineffective activities of the organization it replaced , the league of nations . 
this year , the u.n. 's budget increased to $ 1.8 billion . 
of that $ 1.8 billion , we pay a substantial part of the cost of the u.n . 
these reforms are necessary . 
moving the programs that this bill suggests be moved to voluntary programs only increases the willingness of people to support those programs , the transparency of those programs . 
i strongly urge support for this bill . 
i strongly urge support for the penalties that it contains . 
i appreciate my friend , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 , and also our great ranking member of this committee , the gentleman from california ( mr. lantos ) xz4002310 .
