mr. chairman , i want to recognize the significance of this medal , that it is not given out willy-nilly ; that , as i mentioned before , it takes extraordinary measures to get enough support to get this medal passed . 
i recognize that the first person who received this medal was general george washington , prior to him becoming president of the united states , when the country was brand new , when we did not have the richness of diversity and of events that have taken place throughout the history of our country ever since this first medal was given to george washington ; that we have grown as a nation , in size and in stature ; and that there have been many events that have occurred throughout our history since the striking of the first medal that have inured greatly to the advancement of our country that from time to time need to be recognized . 
that is what this medal gives an opportunity to do , both to individuals and to groups . 
certainly general washington was an incredible individual , someone who was deserving of the first medal that was ever produced , and i think he accepted that on behalf of all those men and women who fought for independence from great britain back during the war of independence . 
but certainly we have grown in size , both in states , from thirteen colonies and states to 50 states , and the number of people in this country have grown incredibly since the founding of this nation , and the events that have occurred throughout our history has certainly changed the shape of the distribution of this medal as well . 
i think that needs to be recognized and taken into consideration . 
i thank the gentleman for yielding .
