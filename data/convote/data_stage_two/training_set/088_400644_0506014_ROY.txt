i am full of charts today , my friends . 
i do want to address our funding for health and for research . 
under a republican-controlled congress , we have doubled funding for nih , the national institutes of health . 
i think it is important to note what we are doing in health research as an american government , and the american people need to know that we are fully funding these programs to look at innovative ways to solve pressing medical issues in our country . 
we have doubled the funding for nih over the last 6 years .
