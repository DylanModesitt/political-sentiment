i thought what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 did by making a performance of duty was a wise thing . 
i think that was a wise move of the gentleman . 
i do not know why the gentleman would be upset with regard to my remarks on performance of duty because what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 did is followed what we , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. evans ) xz4001260 and i , had also recommended . 
performance of duty is a good thing .
