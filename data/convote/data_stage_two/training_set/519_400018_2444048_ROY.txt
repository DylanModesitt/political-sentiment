but the strategic petroleum reserve is a reserve that you take crude oil and store it so if we need it you bring it up and transmit it to refineries to be refined into refined products . 
a strategic refinery reserve , as i understand it in this bill , you actually go out and build the refineries , and it is unclear to me whether you would operate them around the clock or just in some sort of an emergency . 
i do understand that you require the secretary of energy to transmit the plan . 
but if the secretary of energy did not want to operate them continuously , i guess he would have that authority in the plan to have them as a sort of ready reserve .
