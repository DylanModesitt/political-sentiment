mr. speaker , i would say to the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 , i appreciate the expeditious way he has responded to this crises . 
if there is a silver lining to the hurricane katrina crisis , it is that it has opened the eyes of congress and our business community to the urgent need to add to the capacity of our oil refineries . 
the fact that gas prices shot up in the wake of this monstrous hurricane is a reflection of the reality that we do not have the capability to meet the sort of refining needs the country has that will put the kind of pressure on gas prices that are so important to our consuming public . 
hurricane katrina is telling us very clearly that we have a challenge and an opportunity here to increase that capacity . 
in the last year , i met on several occasions with adel al-jubeir , a representative of the country of saudi arabia . 
on any number of occasions he has rather smiled at me saying america does not have the capacity to provide the gasoline that your consuming public needs . 
you have not built a refinery in three generations . 
we do have that opportunity by this action today , and i strongly urge the house to recognize it . 
this is the one chance for us to make a long-term commitment to reducing gasoline prices . 
i strongly urge an `` aye '' vote on this measure .
