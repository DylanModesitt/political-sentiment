reclaiming my time , i will say that the president has said in that speech that we will remain in iraq as long as necessary and not 1 day longer . 
that is very clear to me , and so it is obvious . 
mr. speaker , i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the very , very able fighter for freedom , our great friend from springdale , south carolina ( mr. wilson ) xz4004331 .
