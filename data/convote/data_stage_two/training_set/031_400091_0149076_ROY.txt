mr. chairman , i would say to my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. farr ) xz4001290 , during the last debate i invited him to come down and look at the 7-mile area in that fence , because it is a problem . 
i am looking forward to working with him , because if you are an environmentalist , it is hard pan . 
i mean , it has totally destroyed the plants , the animals , the lizards , and it is like a venturi tube . 
the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 first came to me in 1990 and asked where we could get landing mat , and we put that up . 
why ? 
because the number of rapes of mexicans who were coming across , the number of drugs that were coming across . 
there is one strand of wire on the ground where you could just drive from one field to another with a loaded truck , and it has stopped a lot of that . 
does the fence stop illegal immigration ? 
no . 
but it sure frees up a lot of the border patrol and makes it easier for them , and that 7 miles is like a venturi tube and it forces our border patrol into that area . 
i agree with the gentleman from texas ( mr. reyes ) xz4003370 , and i am going to work with anybody over there , especially him , because he does have the expertise and he is a good friend . 
i agree with him that the president 's budget does not include the funding . 
but no clinton budget ever passed either , and we are going to add that ; and with the help of my friend , we are going to add the funding for those new border patrol .
