mr. speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
let me simply say with respect to idea , aid to the disabled children , the fact is , this bill cuts the federal share of that program from 18.6 percent to 18 percent . 
and under the across-the-board cut that will be coming shortly , it drops further to 17.8 percent . 
in all , the bill will provide $ 4 billion less than the glide path to full funding that the republican budget resolution promised just 2 years ago . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from connecticut ( ms. delauro ) xz4001030 .
