mr. speaker , very briefly , section 1 of the motion to recommit would simply provide that we fund the programs covered under the continuing resolution at the current rate rather than at the lower of either the current rate of the house-passed or the senate-passed bill . 
i have already explained the impact of that on program . 
section 2 would simply repeal the president 's edict that workers in the katrina-affected region would not be subject to the protections of davis-bacon wage protections . 
section 3 would simply guarantee that the milc program remains in force for the same length of time as other titles of the farm bill . 
and section 4 would require a reduction in the size of the tax cuts for taxpayers with incomes of over $ 400 , 000 , as i just described in my previous remarks .
