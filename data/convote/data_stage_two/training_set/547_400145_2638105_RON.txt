madam chairman , i yield myself 1 minute . 
we must remember what the original focus of the gses was when they were initially chartered by this congress , they were to do two things , and that is to provide liquidity to the marketplace and also to help provide for facilitating low-income buyers coming into the marketplace . 
it is already set up in the law that the amount that gses can lend can go up every year . 
as it is right now , it stands at $ 359 , 000 . 
it is set to go up to $ 400 , 000 for next year , in 2006 . 
as the bill was amended in committee , it comes out now that that will go up by 50 percent . 
i ask the question , how would we define somebody who is about to buy a $ 600 , 000 home ? 
that individual would have to be making an income of around $ 200 , 000 . 
even if they are firemen , policemen , teachers , who have you , they would still need an income of $ 200 , 000 in order to buy a home at $ 600 , 000 . 
that was not the intent of gses . 
the intent was to help the low-income market to get their homes . 
by allowing the gses to get into this market , what we are doing is distracting them from their purpose and hurting those very people that they were intended to help : low-income people , whether they are in new jersey or california or other high-interest-rate states , to be able to buy their first time . 
madam chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
