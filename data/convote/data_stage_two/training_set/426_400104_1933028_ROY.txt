mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman yielding . 
we are working on it . 
we hope to get it done by the end of next week . 
it is a very ambitious goal , i must say , to take a bill of this magnitude and , in a matter of 2 weeks , get all the differences worked out between the house and the senate and bring it to the floor . 
this is another item that the house and senate are working on through the weekend , and at least encouragement has been brought to my attention by the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce that , with a lot of hard work , it is very possible that we could get this energy conference report to the members for a vote by the end of next week .
