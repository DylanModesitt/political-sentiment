mr. speaker , i yield myself 5 seconds . 
i tell my dear friend who just left the well , we are not here to debate the bill . 
we debated the bill in committee . 
we debated it on the floor . 
we are talking about the titles in the section that were mislabeled . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , the ranking member of the committee on rules .
