mr. speaker , it was with heavy hearts and steady resolve that we came to the house chamber on palm sunday to pass s. 686 , a carefully crafted bill with a singular purpose : to ensure that terri schiavo enjoys the same due process under the constitution as any other citizen , and to guarantee that her right to life is fully protected . 
this is an extraordinary situation , one that requires an extraordinary response . 
this is a life or death situation for this young woman . 
terri 's parents should have the chance to have her case heard by a federal judge , and now they will . 
if we make an error , we should err on the side of life .
