mr. chairman , i note that the gentleman from ohio included in the committee report a provision directing the secretary of energy to begin moving commercial spent nuclear fuel into interim storage at one or more department of energy sites . 
i want to be sure that your intent is for the secretary to focus his attention on existing doe sites and not go looking for private sites that might be used for interim storage . 
is my understanding of the gentleman 's intent correct ?
