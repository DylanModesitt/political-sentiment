mr. speaker , i agree with my distinguished friend from new york ( mr. reynolds ) xz4003380 that the republicans did send a signal to protect the alternative minimum tax . 
we want to do a lot more . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr. mcdermott ) xz4002620 , who can explain the difference between what you want to do and what we want to do in this substitute .
