mr. speaker , why is congress approving yet another multibillion dollar spending bill when the previous 3 multibillion dollar spending bills have been misused , improperly managed , and , in some cases , downright stolen ? 
a report by the special inspector general for iraq 's reconstruction has stated that nearly $ 100 million for reconstruction projects in southern iraq is missing and can not be accounted for . 
these funds must be accounted for before allotting one more dollar for the war in iraq . 
and where is the congressional investigation into the $ 9 billion that mysteriously disappeared from the books at the coalition provisional authority ? 
why are we voting on writing another check for a mission that has been so badly botched ? 
who is being held responsible for the misinformation that led us into the war in the first place ? 
who is being held responsible for the troops not being equipped and armed with the billions of dollars that we have allocated to iraq ? 
where is our exit strategy ? 
this bill is nothing short of highway robbery , and the victims are the troops and the american people . 
no more blank checks , mr. speaker . 
no more wars without reason . 
i will vote against the supplemental .
