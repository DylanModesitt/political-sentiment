mr. speaker , a month ago , i voted against h.r. 3010 , the labor , health and human services , education and related agencies first conference report , which failed in the house with 22 republicans also voting against the bill . 
today , a similar bill with some minor tweaks to gain a few more votes for a narrow passage is before the house again . 
while i am glad to see $ 90 million restored to rural health programs , the overall bill is still bad . 
it is irresponsible to raid from one program to pay for another program . 
this bill contains $ 1.6 billion in cuts from fy 2005 to important labor , health , social services , and education services . 
it is unfortunate that republicans in congress are choosing to strip away essential safeguards for families in order to implement tax cuts benefiting the wealthiest americans . 
i am voting against this bill because americans deserve better .
