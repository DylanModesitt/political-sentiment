mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from ohio ( chairman hobson ) for his leadership in delivering a comprehensive and bipartisan appropriations bill to the floor today . 
he has taken the responsibility as chairman of the subcommittee very seriously . 
he has been to new jersey , to our home state . 
he has seen the channel deepening project , and he takes a real interest in the projects found in his bill , and i thank him very much for his leadership . 
on a more personal note , i also want to thank the chairman for supporting the green brook flood control project , which is in my district in new jersey . 
my constituents in new jersey thank him for his commitment to this project . 
i would also be remiss if i did not mention the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. frelinghuysen ) xz4001420 . 
for more than 5 years , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. frelinghuysen ) xz4001420 , as a member of the committee on appropriations , has been a champion for the green brook flood control project . 
he deserves significant credit for its success and the thanks of thousands of residents whose safety and livelihood in our area of new jersey are very much at stake with the success of this project . 
the gentleman from ohio ( chairman hobson ) and every member of the committee on appropriations has a considerable task and responsibility of prioritizing local projects . 
there are no easy decisions , particularly in a difficult and a tight budget year like this year . 
the green brook flood control project is saving homes and businesses and lives . 
it is equally vital that our senators from new jersey take up the fight for this important project and finish the work that we have begun here in the house . 
again i want to thank the gentleman from ohio ( chairman hobson ) , and i want to thank the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. frelinghuysen ) xz4001420 for their compassion and their vision and their leadership and commitment to this issue .
