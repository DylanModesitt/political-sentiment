mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , we did , following the introduction of the brac process , but we did close that . 
but we basically do not have the power to do that , because if i have the power to close mr. skelton 's base , he might vote to close my base , and we keep going around the room like that , and we are unable to do it . 
so the brac process has worked for better or for worse . 
i see both sides of it . 
i chaired a committee that oversees the brac process . 
i do not want any more brac processes like this . 
but i would remind my colleagues again that if we vote for this resolution , and this resolution passes today , and we turn down this brac process , we will be back here in this room a year from now or 2 years from now , probably more like a year from now , we will be back in this room dealing with another brac process , and we will have the same arguments as we are having here today . 
now , it may be different people . 
maybe some of the people that are dissatisfied today will be satisfied at the next round , but we would all have to go through this again next year or the next . 
and we would , all of our communities that have any base connected to them would have to go through this again . 
i am not sure we would get any better results , no matter what process we use , than we have today . 
some would be happy , some would be unhappy , some would complain , some would want it to go just like it is . 
i think we would end up with the same kinds of results as we have today . 
so while i agree that this is not a perfect process , i do not think we want to go through it again next year . 
i would ask each of my colleagues to vote against this resolution , and let us proceed to make the best we possibly can out of this for the defense of this country .
