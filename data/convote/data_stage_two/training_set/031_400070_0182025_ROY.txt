mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for her good questions and for yielding . 
we are not sure at this point whether they include that information or not at tsa , because simply they have databases and we do not know necessarily what is in their databases , and i do not blame them at all . 
they are not prone to reveal all of that . 
it is our judgment they should be doing this . 
we hope that they would be doing it . 
we do not know if they are for sure or not . 
i can not confirm or deny that , because we simply do not know the answer to that particular question . 
i would imagine , and i am putting myself in their position and i am not an expert on this , but if you are there and are in the security forces there , you are obviously trained in document recognition to some great degree . 
some are better probably than others at this . 
obviously , if one has a database , it is obviously much more of a clear signal that this person needs to be looked at because they tried to do this before . 
that is the reason we feel it should be added into the database as it goes on . 
i do not think this is going to change actually the way they look at licenses presently in the first instance or even in second instance . 
it is just a trigger mark as other things might be in terms of potential risks .
