mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
in the 105th congress , h.r. 3150 , bankruptcy reform , passed 306-118 . 
in the 106th congress , h.r. 8333 passed the house , 313-108 . 
in the 107th congress , h.r. 333 passed the house 306-108 . 
in the 108th congress , h.r. 975 passed the house 315-113 . 
the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 was not one of those voting in the affirmative on any of those occasions , but i want to point out to the gentleman in regard to his concern over medical and health-related expenses for a debtor , spouse , and dependents , on line 23 , page 8 , continuing through line 10 page 9 , this covers the treatment of medical expenses for the debtor , spouse of the debtor , and dependents of the debtor . 
it expressly includes not just actual medical expenses but expenses for health insurances , disability insurance , and health savings accounts . 
mr. speaker , put another way , contrary to misrepresentations by opponents , the needs-based test not only takes into account the full range of medical expenses by the debtors , but it also covers the spouse and dependents . 
this is just one of three provisions for a member of the household or immediate family . 
the provision includes for the monthly expense of the debtor , expenses incurred for the care and support of an elderly , chronically ill or disabled member of the debtor 's immediate family . 
this includes parents , grandparents , siblings , children and grandchildren of the debtor , among others . 
so medical in any situation , mr. speaker , medical or otherwise , no debtor is denied access to bankruptcy relief . 
all s. 256 says is that , in a limited range of cases , a debtor with meaningful capacity to repay may have to file in chapter 13 as opposed to chapter 7. in no case is a debtor denied access to the bankruptcy system . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
