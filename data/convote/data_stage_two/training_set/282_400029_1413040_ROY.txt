mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the opportunity for having had a very quality debate here today . 
it is interesting to note once again that the ranking member and the chairman have said the need for reform is obvious . 
there is no disagreement on that point . 
it is seemingly the mechanism of doing that . 
once again i point out that in 1985 , 1994 and 1999 , this house set precedent by doing the exact same concept that is there . 
and it is true that maybe i have heard a new concept here that i do not need to make all ten commandments to get to heaven , but i also know that when i was in my classroom and i put high standards and high expectations , my kids met those standards ; and if i wavered , then they wavered at the same time . 
this is a good piece of legislation . 
it is an excellent rule , and i urge its adoption and passage of the underlying legislation . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
the previous question was ordered . 
the resolution was agreed to . 
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .
