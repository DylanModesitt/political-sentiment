mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
to the best of my knowledge , there is nothing in the emtala act that requires states and localities to actually pass laws and regulations creating sanctuary states , creating sanctuary cities , becoming magnets for illegal aliens themselves . 
there is nothing that requires them to do that ; yet they do that . 
then they come here and say , we are having a problem . 
it is undeniably true that the problem exists . 
it is undeniably true that they are being overwhelmed by illegal immigration . 
it is also undeniably true that much of this is the fault of the federal government . 
i do not deny that for a moment . 
nor do i deny that there may be some responsibility here for us to help pay for it . 
but what i am saying is you pass a law like this and then you pass regulations that make it completely and totally irrelevant in a way to determine . 
they say , we do n't want to ask . 
we can not ask . 
we will not even ask you if you are here illegally . 
by the way , even if you are n't here illegally , if you are one of the 5 million people who live in mexico , mexican nationals who have a border crossing card , we 'll treat you also . 
does that not encourage even more people to come to the united states and obtain these services , putting even more of a burden on these hospitals ? 
of course it does . 
these regulations are the problem . 
they are a significant problem that only exacerbates the underlying problem of massive costs being incurred by these hospitals in these states . 
my hope is that if in fact we have to put money into a program like this , we do so only after we have passed meaningful and purposeful regulations , regulations that at least make these hospitals accountable .
