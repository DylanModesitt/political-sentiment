mr. chairman , as the gentleman from florida is aware , the budget is very tight this year ; and due to the lack of federal funds , many projects the committee supported in the past did not receive appropriations this year . 
because money is tight , locals will need to do more with less and finish this with other local money . 
as the gentleman knows , i have got three grandchildren living in florida ; so i am interested in the state of florida , and i appreciate the gentleman 's bringing this to our attention .
