mr. speaker , unless we enact h.r. 4297 and defeat the democratic substitute , americans will receive a most unwelcome christmas gift from the democrats , a huge automatic tax increase . 
this will cost families billions of dollars and jeopardize millions of their jobs . 
mr. speaker , let me tell you just about a few of those jobs that could be lost in my east texas district if the democrats have their way in raising taxes . 
hugh dublin owns a small business called east texas right of way in my district . 
he specializes in the leasing of land . 
due to tax relief , his company has grown from two full-time employees to four full-time employees . 
his two new employees are called dan and david . 
they were unemployed . 
they were out of work . 
but due to the expansion of this business , they were able to start new careers . 
the democrats now want to raise taxes on hugh dublin and his small business . 
they want to jeopardize dan and david 's paychecks and replace them with welfare checks , and this they call compassion . 
eddie alexander owns triple s electric in henderson , texas , an electrical contracting business . 
since the passage of our economic growth program with tax relief , he has been able to hire two more full-time employees , jared and john , both of whom were out of work , but both now provide homes for their families . 
the democrats want to raise taxes on eddie alexander and his small business . 
they want to jeopardize jared and john 's paychecks and replace them with welfare checks , and this they call compassion . 
gil travers owns travers & amp ; company , a home building company in athens , texas . 
due to the housing boom from tax relief , they have had to hire three new workers , jan , calvin and christy . 
they were all previously unemployed . 
they have been hired to help clean up all of the job sites from the new homes . 
but the democrats now want to raise taxes on gil travers and his small business . 
they want to jeopardize jan 's , calvin 's , and christy 's paychecks and replace them with welfare checks , and this they call compassion . 
mr. speaker , tax relief has credited 4.4 million new tax-paying jobs with a future : 4.4 million hardworking americans can now provide for their families this christmas . 
and more than just providing food and shelter , these jobs are providing new-found hope and opportunity . 
we can not go back . 
we must prevent this democratic tax increase .
