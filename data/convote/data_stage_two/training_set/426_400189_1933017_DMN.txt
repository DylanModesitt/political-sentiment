i appreciate that . 
on the bill of the gentleman from arizona ( mr. shadegg ) xz4003680 , i think it is h.r. 2355 , dealing with the insurance issues , there is a lot of interest on our side of the aisle . 
will that bill be considered ? 
did you list that as one of the health bills that would be considered ?
