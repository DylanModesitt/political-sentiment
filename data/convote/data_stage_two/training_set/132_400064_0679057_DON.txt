just to correct the record , and the leader is correct . 
we did vote against the package . 
the package was developed in a very bipartisan manner through the task force . 
there were some votes that took place on the floor of the house that were recommended against by the task force that changed some of the recommendations , and we had a motion to recommit to try to clarify that . 
the gentleman is correct on the final vote , but the package itself was very much developed in a bipartisan manner through the task force in a way that it should have been done , contrary to the process that was used on this rules package .
