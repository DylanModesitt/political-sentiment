and it is just so important that everybody realize this connection between preserving tax relief , preventing a tax increase and preserving our jobs . 
again , over 4 million new jobs created in this economy since we passed tax relief . 
why would we want to go back ? 
why would we want to take that tax relief away and pass a huge tax increase , because that affects real people all across america . 
let me give you another example . 
i talked earlier about the fact that we are enjoying the highest rate of homeownership in the history of the united states of america . 
i mean , home ownership , part and parcel of the american dream . 
well , somebody has to go out and help renovate those homes and build new homes . 
and one of those gentleman is in my congressional district back in texas , a gentleman by the name of gil travers of travers and company . 
he is a home builder . 
prior to us passing the economic growth legislation with the tax relief , he had just a handful of workers ; but once we passed the tax relief , he had to hire extra workers . 
he hired a lady named jan , who was unemployed , to help him clean up some of his job sites . 
she got so busy that she had to hire two people who were unemployed to help her clean up the job site , a gentleman by the name of calvin and another lady by the name of christy , all because of tax relief . 
and yet this week the democrats want to raise taxes on travers and company home builders . 
they want to jeopardize the pay checks of jan and calvin and christy and replace them with welfare checks , and they call that compassion .
