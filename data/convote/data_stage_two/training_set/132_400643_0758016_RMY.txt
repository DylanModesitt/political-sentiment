mr. speaker , i want to thank the gentlewoman very much for organizing this effort on behalf of h.r. 6 , the energy policy act of 2005 . 
as we all know , gas prices are skyrocketing , as are the costs of heating and cooling our homes . 
many families and businesses are struggling under the additional financial burden . 
i am encouraged we have the opportunity to tackle this issue head on and take the necessary steps to reduce the cost of energy . 
hard-working americans are depending on us to take action . 
h.r. 6 will lower energy prices , strengthen the economy , generate hundreds of thousands of new jobs , and encourage greater energy conservation and efficiency . 
this bill will also reduce our dependence on foreign oil and encourage investment into alternative energy sources . 
furthermore , this bill will provide relief to our hard-working farmers by providing tax incentives and money for research and development for ethanol and biodiesel energy sources . 
i hope all of our colleagues are going to vote for this vital piece of legislation .
