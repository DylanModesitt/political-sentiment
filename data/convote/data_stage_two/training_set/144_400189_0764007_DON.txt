mr. chairman , i thank my friend for that information . 
again , i do not know the accuracy of the letter in terms of the numbers of people , but there seemed to be a fair number of people , there were over 40 , on the letter which appeared to agree with the senate 's view , obviously a large number on this side who share that view as well . 
perhaps we might have some discussions about reaching agreement on that issue at some point in time .
