mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 1268 , the emergency supplemental and wartime appropriations act of 2005 . 
this supplemental provides necessary funding for a variety of military operations and for equipment that will keep our troops safe while they fight the war on terror . 
we are asking the brave men and women of our armed forces to put their lives on the line in defense of our freedom . 
in return , we should not hesitate to give them the best protective gear that we can provide . 
however , i have serious concerns about providing additional non-defense and nonemergency items , such as money for facility construction and international peacekeeping efforts that are included in this supplemental . 
i believe that while these items may be vital to our nation 's interests , they are not true emergencies . 
i commend the chairman of the appropriations committee , the distinguished gentleman from california , mr. lewis , for his efforts to limit the amount of non-defense and nonemergency funding in this bill . 
but , far too often the federal government deems additional spending an `` emergency '' because it was not included in the original budget request . 
any non-defense and non-emergency funding should be considered in the regular budget process . 
as members of congress , we owe it to the american taxpayer to ensure any new request for emergency spending is thoroughly reviewed and considered in a fair manner on the house floor , especially when essential funding for our nation 's armed forces is at stake . 
despite my displeasure in allowing some of these additional items to be included in the supplemental , i support this legislation because congress has a moral obligation to provide our troops with the safest equipment and most up to date training available .
