madam chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
if the bill passes or does not pass , it will still be illegal to stab someone 16 times . 
what we ought to be looking at are the kinds of initiatives that will reduce the chances that that will happen again . 
giving a 10-year mandatory minimum for a second offense fist fight is not going to reduce the chance that someone will be stabbed 16 times when you are not funding any of the programs that are desperately needed to actually reduce juvenile crime . 
madam chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 .
