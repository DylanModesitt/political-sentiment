mr. speaker , i thank my friend for yielding me this time . 
i rise in strong support of the henry j. hyde u.n . 
reform act of 2005 . 
it is tough but necessary medicine designed to finally at long last reform the united nations so that they can realize the noble dream of its founders . 
today the united nations is rife with scandal , corruption , hypocrisy , and missed opportunity . 
clearly there are bright and committed people at the u.n. , and i applaud them . 
but others with less laudable motives often hijack the u.n . 
mission , its programs , and undermine the vital missions of the united nations . 
those of us who believe the u.n . 
can and must do better refuse to accept the status quo . 
business as usual just does not cut it . 
the henry j. hyde u.n . 
reform act of 2005 injects real and measurable accountability into the united nations , and that is exceedingly important in a myriad of areas including the area of peacekeeping operations and in human rights . 
i want to thank the gentleman from illinois ( chairman hyde ) for his great leadership on this and on so many human rights issues around the world . 
this is important legislation . 
i hope the body will support it .
