mr. chairman , section 1287 of h.r. 6 includes permissive rulemaking authority for the federal trade commission to adopt rules protecting the privacy of electric consumers from the disclosure of consumer information obtained in connection with the sale or delivery of electric energy to electric customers . 
am i correct , sir , in understanding that it was the committee 's intent to grant the ftc rulemaking authority with respect to the information practices of utility companies not already regulated , or to the extent they are not already regulated , under the gramm-leach-bliley act ?
