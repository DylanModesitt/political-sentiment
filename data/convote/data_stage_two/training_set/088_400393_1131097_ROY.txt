mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
mr. chairman , i rise to engage the chairman of the interior subcommittee in a colloquy dealing with some language in the committee report requiring the epa to fund a national academy of science study . 
mr. chairman , we have already heard that there is language requiring such a study to determine the effectiveness and cost of a large dredging operation of hazardous waste sites , many of which are contaminated with pcbs . 
i would point out that our colleague , the gentleman from new york ( mr. hinchey ) xz4001780 , who engaged in a colloquy a little earlier , stated that there was strong support for this project . 
well , this is a project that has been debated for 20 years . 
in some ways that is an overstatement of that support . 
i represent the affected area , and in fact it has been an extremely difficult process for my constituents . 
however , we all agree that further delay of the project is in no one 's best interest . 
as you have already clarified , the report language , mr. chairman , in no way is intended to delay , stop or otherwise disrupt the cleanup planned for the hudson river slated to begin in the summer of 12006 . 
further , the epa has reviewed the language and found no provision that would require them to disrupt the hudson river project in any way . 
is that your understanding , mr. chairman ?
