madam chairman , i move to strike the last word . 
madam chairman , i wish to extend my gratitude on behalf of the entire florida delegation to the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002391 and the gentleman from kentucky ( mr. mike rogers ) for entering into this colloquy with us regarding a very crucial issue to florida as well as this congress . 
last fall the state of florida withstood an historic four hurricanes causing enormous devastation and damage to property , waterways , homes and individuals ' lives . 
i commend the relief efforts on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane as well as the willingness of congress to step forward and offer meaningful relief to hurricane victims . 
but there are two issues for which the department of homeland security , federal emergency management agency should recognize under their current statutory authority to effectively address florida hurricane-related damage . 
congress appropriated funds to respond to the hurricane devastation through the military construction appropriations and emergency hurricane supplemental appropriations act 2005 , public law 108-324 , and the emergency supplemental of 2004 , public law 108-303 . 
at this time , madam chairman , i would like to yield to the distinguished chairman , the gentleman from kentucky ( mr. mike rogers ) , to ask how was florida hurricane disaster aid reflected in the designation of fema disaster relief funds ?
