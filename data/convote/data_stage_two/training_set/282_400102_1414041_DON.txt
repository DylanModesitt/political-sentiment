mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , again , let me provide this as an update , because this is a report by the associated press from today , titled `` u.n . 
oil-for-food author of e-mail memo says he never discussed oil-for-food contract bid with kofi annan . 
the executive who wrote an e-mail suggesting that the u.n . 
secretary general kofi annan may have known about a u.n . 
contract awarded to his son 's company has denied ever discussing the firm 's bid with annan , a law firm said wednesday. '' so , again , i think it is worthy of a review , clearly worthy of an investigation ; but i do find it interesting that when we talk about investigations that we have not taken the opportunity to investigate the report by the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction of the report by an american official indicating that the coalition provisional authority provided less than adequate controls for approximately $ 9 billion of development funds for iraq funds provided to iraq through the national budget process . 
we can not find that money .
