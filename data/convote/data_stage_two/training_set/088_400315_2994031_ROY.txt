mr. speaker , i rise simply to express profound gratitude for the leadership that chairman ralph regula has provided in bringing this extraordinary measure to the floor . 
i also commend the chairman of the appropriations committee , the gentleman from california , for his leadership . 
the challenge of being in the spending branch of government is to fund the nation 's priorities and to live within our means . 
and this legislation for fiscal year 2006 , with labor , health and human services and education , does just that . 
the story goes that chairman ralph regula was at the white house , saw ronald reagan and they talked about the fence at the reagan ranch . 
and a day later , ralph regula received a handwritten set of instructions about how to build a fence that is on the wall of his office today . 
what is clear today to house conservatives is that ralph regula learned more than just how to build a fence from ronald reagan . 
he learned how to fund the nation 's priorities with the fiscal discipline that characterizes this governing party . 
and for that , i am grateful .
