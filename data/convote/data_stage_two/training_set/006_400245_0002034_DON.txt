mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the proposed changes in the ethics rules . 
i served for 8 years on the committee on standards of official conduct , and it is not an enviable assignment . 
but members who have never served on the committee would be proud of how these tasks are approached . 
it is a committee that is evenly split . 
in the 8 years i served , we had unanimous votes . 
the members who serve think about the institution . 
they are there to serve the american people and the institution . 
it has not been a partisan body . 
it has been one that holds other members to a high ethical standard . 
these rules will undermine the committee on standards of official conduct , and the process of using the committee on rules rather than the committee on standards of official conduct to deliberate on the changes is also undercutting the committee on standards of official conduct . 
i recommend that we do not support these rule changes . 
and i also want to mention on the homeland security provision of the rule , it is a huge mistake to `` murky up '' the jurisdiction over cybersecurity . 
we are at tremendous risk for a cyberattack , and the changes in that area will make us less safe .
