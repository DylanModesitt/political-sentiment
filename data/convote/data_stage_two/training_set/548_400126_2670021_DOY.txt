mr. chairman , today i rise in support of h. j. res. 65 . 
i totally disagree with the base realignment and closure commission 's decision pertaining to rock island arsenal and other key installations across the nation , including springfield air base as well . 
the brac process is seriously flawed . 
both the department of defense and the brac commission failed to follow the criteria established by congress to base its decisions on military values and cost savings . 
i expected the dod and the commission to follow the criteria outlined in the brac legislation . 
it failed to do so . 
the brac commission stated it will actually cost the american taxpayer with no further expectation of future savings . 
the government will never receive a financial payback from this move . 
the brac commission recommended realignment of installations in the 17th congressional district of illinois , but failed to base its decision on military value criteria . 
rock island dfas was rated number one in military value , but the commission recommended consolidation at facilities rated substantially below rock island : columbus , 7 ; indianapolis , 9 ; cleveland , 12 ; limestone , 17 ; rome 19 . 
the brac decisions regarding not only bases in illinois , but throughout the nation , are extremely frustrating because the commission recognized the military value and cost savings provided streamlining of bases already undertaken on a local level . 
i am a former marine , and i will not surrender this fight to save jobs at the rock island arsenal . 
i will continue to work with the quad city development group and local officials to strengthen the arsenal and to bring more jobs to the island . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from peoria , illinois who has done an outstanding job in fighting this battle . 
i look forward to working with him on the cleanup of this process and hope that we do not have to go through it again . 
i appreciate his leading the charge on this bill today .
