mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i appreciate the comments of the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 . 
we can not measure contribution by number , we have to measure by weight . 
however , mr. chairman , i think you are still going to win the debate . 
by the way , i am a new member of the commerce committee . 
i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 , the chairman , for the very fair-minded way that he handled this in committee , in giving both sides an adequate degree of leeway to argue their positions . 
we all appreciate his leadership . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time .
