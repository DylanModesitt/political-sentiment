mr. chairman , i just went back to my office after i spoke , and i heard the gentleman speaking just now . 
and he talked about waste , fraud and abuse . 
and my question to the gentleman is , you have been through the budget hearings . 
why do you suppose it is that the bush administration over the last 50 months has not rooted out that waste , fraud , and abuse ?
