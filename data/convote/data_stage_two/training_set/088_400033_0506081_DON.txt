mr. chairman , the republican budget resolution is a body blow to oregon and the country . 
i have heard from constituents , school teachers , local government officials , medical professionals , housing advocates and many others throughout the communities in my district , all with detailed stories about how this budget will have devastating impacts . 
the budget cuts both ways . 
first , by exploding the federal deficit , adding $ 376 billion to the national debt and spending every penny of the $ 185 billion social security trust fund surplus coming in during the year . 
then , by eliminating and reducing key domestic priorities , such as cutting $ 4.3 billion of education programs , slashing $ 1.5 billion for affordable housing and development programs , and underfunding veterans ' programs by nearly $ 800 million . 
how do we face both increased deficits and program cuts ? 
by continuing to focus on tax cuts for those who need them the least . 
this is unnecessary and , frankly , dangerous as we continue to create an abyss between the haves and have-nots in society , and are putting our financial markets on edge by borrowing trillions from foreign investors . 
this is not a budget representative of the priorities and values of oregonians .
