mr. chairman , i want to say upfront to the house that it is not my intention to speak on the time i have reserved in opposition to this proposition , so i am asking for a chance for an exchange here with the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 . 
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 and i have spent a good deal of time behind closed doors in appropriate security to discuss matters like this , but especially to express our concern that the department of defense communicate regularly with the congress relative to activities that might involve areas that are , indeed , secure . 
i have never told the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 this before , but i will never forget as a mere member of the subcommittee on defense and a member of the intelligence committee discussing a program that was in the black that i knew about because i happened to be in the back room , but a program that the department of defense was not very excited about . 
we ended up advancing some money to have that program go forward . 
i have no idea if we would have been unsuccessful with that effort if they had known how serious we were . 
it is important that we communicate with each other . 
communication is a two-way street not a one-way street . 
so for those listening across the river , it is very important to know that the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 is serious about this , and the leadership of the house is serious about it as well .
