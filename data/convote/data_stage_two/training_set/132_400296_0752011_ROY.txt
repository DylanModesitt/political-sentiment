mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i thank the gentleman very much . 
as he knows , i agree participatory means `` everybody pays , '' and those that reap the advantages of this , which will be the generators of electricity and the receivers of electricity , need to pay . 
and i am all right with that . 
i thank my colleague , and i look forward to working with him on this as we move forward toward conference .
