i thank the chairman . 
we are making the point that we are dealing with sovereignty . 
yes , this is an imperfect world . 
but i scarcely imagine that a gross violation of human rights will transpire when we live up to article i , section 8 of the constitution , which says : the congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , states , and with the indian tribes . 
tribes have sovereign immunity . 
they have sovereignty . 
it is not situational , no matter what some leaders in the afl-cio may say .
