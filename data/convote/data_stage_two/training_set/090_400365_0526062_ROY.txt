mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute . 
mr. speaker , i am a little bit puzzled , listening to my friend from new york . 
at 151 & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record , page h1599 , the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 said , `` if a person thinks a court in a state is depriving someone of civil rights , they can go into federal court. '' and at volume 150 & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record at page h6580 , the gentleman from new york noted that without federal courts , `` obviously , the progress we have witnessed in the area of civil rights would have been , at the very least , stymied , and most likely prevented altogether. '' now , all this bill does is to allow the parents of terri schiavo to go into federal court to adjudicate her federal constitutional and legal rights . 
no more , no less . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. schwarz ) xz4006370 .
