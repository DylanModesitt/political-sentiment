mr. speaker , our goal must be to honor the wishes of theresa schiavo regarding this difficult end-of-life decision . 
we are a nation of laws . 
that is what distinguishes our country from so many others . 
in this case , the courts of the state of florida have thoroughly reviewed the facts of this case and weighed the evidence about what theresa schiavo would want . 
they have concluded that theresa schiavo , through her words and deeds before her accident , would not want to be kept artificially alive in a persistent vegetative state . 
the congress should not now substitute its judgment for that of theresa schiavo and the florida courts . 
who are we to impose our own personal preferences in this case ? 
we should not be playing doctor , judge , and jury .
