basically what we are trying to say is that the republican majority in the house and the senate are not only spending american , hard-working taxpayer dollars to subsidize the most profitable industries in the country , the oil industry , the pharmaceutical industry and the top agricultural , the megafarms . 
not only are they doing that , welfare for corporations , and democrats are for ending corporate welfare . 
not only have they provided a welfare state for iraq where we are not going to loan them the money and get the money back , welfare to corporations , welfare to iraq , and then we are cutting the programs that just may lead to economic growth in the united states . 
we have to jump-start this economy , and we are not going to do it by cutting one of the great investments of high-speed rail . 
what a great program for united states of america . 
when i was in china , i went to shanghai . 
they had a magnetic levitation train . 
it is the only one in the world . 
it goes almost 280 miles an hour . 
you are standing up and you are drinking your coffee . 
why is that in shanghai and not in the united states of america ?
