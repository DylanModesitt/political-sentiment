i appreciate the gentleman 's question , and that is the intention . 
but , hopefully , level heads will prevail , and maybe something will happen ; lightning might strike and another agreement may be made . 
certainly we would not do anything without the distinguished whip 's concurrence and okay , in consultation with him , and we will keep the whip advised if there is any unlikely reason for us to come back earlier than 9 o'clock .
