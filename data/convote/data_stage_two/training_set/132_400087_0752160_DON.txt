mr. chairman , this debate comes down to fact v. fiction . 
fiction -- the other side argues that drilling in pristine areas will lower gas prices . 
fact -- the president 's top counselor dan bartlett said this week that there is no magic wand to reduce gas prices . 
fiction -- opening anwr will relieve the u.s. from turning to foreign sources . 
fact -- this bill makes our country more dependent on fossil fuels from places like the mid-east as scientists of all ideologies have stated that the limited amount of oil will not result in a lessening of oil dependency for the u.s. fiction -- opening anwr will weaken opec and strengthen the u.s. fact -- the bush administration 's own department of energy contradicts this point , when it determined last year that if world oil markets continue as they currently do , opec could `` countermand any potential price impact of arctic refuge production by reducing its exports by an equal amount ? 
`` fact -- drilling in anwr will not lower gas prices at the pump ; will not protect our national sovereignty , and will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil . 
fact -- vote for markey-johnson .
