mr. speaker , tonight i stand with terri 's father , a man who raised up his little girl and gave his daughter 's hand in marriage with the understanding that she would be protected in sickness and in health , for better or for worse ; with terri 's mother who brought her into this world and gave her life , and to unite myself with terri 's brother who continues to struggle for his sister . 
together , each of them is simply begging for her life . 
none of my colleagues on the other side are kin to terri . 
none of them are related or are family . 
the only family she has left wants only to provide her with water and nourishment . 
out of florida , there is no justice . 
justice requires her judges to exercise prudence . 
where is the legal analysis that weighs the issue of terri not being allowed a cat scan and further medical diagnostic evaluation ? 
where is the balance of the scales of justice that weighs terri 's family 's parental rights with those of her estranged husband ? 
tonight 's vote says we want a second look at this unique case . 
we want mercy . 
be merciful and find true bravery and justice in preserving the life of terri schiavo .
