mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
the republican majority has already dismantled nearly every government program for people , and now it appears they 're moving on to other species . 
they constantly preach that god 's creations are precious , yet once again they are showing their hypocrisy that they would be so careless with the lives of god 's creatures . 
perhaps if some of these endangered species were in a persistent vegetative state , republicans would come rushing to their aid . 
perhaps if scientists would concede these same plants and animals were fashioned during the week of god 's creating the world , the right wing would be willing to help . 
the republicans want us to believe that this bill represents a fair and balanced way to protect endangered species without infringing on property rights . 
not true . 
this bill grants unprecedented and immeasurable subsidies to land owners rather than ensuring their fair costs are covered ; so much so in fact , that the nonpartisan congressional budget office can not estimate the potential impact to the federal budget . 
this bill is nothing more than an assault on our environment . 
i urge my colleagues to join me , and every environmental organization on god 's green earth , in opposing this bill .
