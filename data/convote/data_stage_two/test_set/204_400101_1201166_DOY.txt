mr. speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
mr. speaker , i just want to say , if people want to donate their embryos to another couple for adoption , our bill allows that . 
but our bill also allows people who do not want to give their embryos for adoption to donate them for science , so the children who are alive today can be cured . 
i assume no one on the other side of this issue would want to force everybody to give up their embryos for adoption , because clearly that would be limiting the choice that people have . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. holt ) xz4001840 .
