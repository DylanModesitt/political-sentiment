madam speaker , the crippling reach of methamphetamine abuse has become the nation 's leading drug problem today , and this is according to a survey by 500 sheriffs departments in 45 states . 
it is cheap to buy . 
it is easy to make . 
it is available everywhere . 
it is highly addictive . 
oftentimes it is addictive after just one use . 
so it is currently replacing cocaine and heroin in many parts of the country . 
it leads to increased crime , child abuse , increases in the jail population . 
in many parts of the country , almost 40 to 50 percent of the jail population is due to methamphetamine abuse . 
however , the main problem anymore is not the mom-and-pop meth lab out in the countryside . 
it is the superlabs . 
right now 60 to 85 percent of the meth in the united states is coming from superlabs in mexico , and this is really hard to trace . 
it is hard to get at . 
the one thing that is needed to make methamphetamine is pseudoephedrine or ephedrine , and this is manufactured in only six or seven locations around the world : czechoslovakia , germany , china , southeast asia and so on . 
this bill would make it more difficult for meth manufacturers to obtain the pseudoephedrine necessary for producing the drug in these superlabs . 
h.r. 3199 includes language the house passed earlier as part of the foreign operations authorization bill . 
it identifies and publicizes the five countries which have the highest rate of diversion of pseudoephedrine to manufacturers of meth . 
we can get the invoices from these manufacturers . 
the department of state could then use its existing authority to reduce or eliminate u.s. foreign aid to those countries which are most contributing to the meth problem . 
this is one thing that gets people 's attention , when you take their foreign aid away , because they are producing meth that is being used in these superlabs . 
it is a good bill . 
it gets to the source of the problem . 
i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner and particularly chairman souder for their hard work on this bill , and i urge support of the underlying legislation .
