mr. speaker , the gentleman that just preceded me , speaking to the house , said that he did not think this experimentation would work . 
well , there is no way it will ever work if we do not allow the research to take place . 
there can be nothing that is more pro-life than trying to pursue research that scientists tell us will lead to cures for ms and diabetes and parkinson 's and other terrible diseases that people now suffer and die from . 
some people have said , well , let us have an alternative ; let us use the stem cells from the umbilical cord . 
mr. speaker , that is not a replacement for embryonic stem cell research that would occur if we passed h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act . 
we need to ensure that scientists have access to all types of stem cells , both adult and embryonic . 
rather than opening the doors to research , the president 's policy of stopping this work at nih has set the united states back . 
it has meant that researchers who see the promise are leaving the national institutes of health . 
it means the edge that this country has had as a leader of research is now falling behind and we look to other countries who are going to take our place . 
for the sake of those who are suffering , for the sake of what science can bring to us , for the sake of life , i urge the adoption of this legislation . 
i do not think it is a good enough excuse to hold up a clump of cells and say , this we value and this we will protect , and then to look at our friends and our colleagues , people we know and people we do not even know , and tell them their lives we do not value . 
the united states is poised to assume a role of leading the world in this promising field . 
vote for this legislation that will make it possible .
