mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 for yielding me time . 
could i ask the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 or the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , is this not kind of unusual ? 
there have been no hearings and we are combining the death penalty by putting together two substantial terrorist crimes , section 1992 and 1993 . 
well , maybe i should ask the author of the bill , if he is on the floor , why this has not had committee consideration .
