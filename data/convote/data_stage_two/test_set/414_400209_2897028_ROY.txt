mr. speaker , i rise in support of this motion to instruct . 
the american people want us to protect them from the terrorists -- but the american people also want us to protect their liberties and constitutional rights from an overreaching government . 
our system of government is made up of checks and balances and this motion to instruct only expands these checks and balances . 
a review every 4 years is the right action to assure american citizens that their civil liberties are protected . 
let me close with a quote attributed to patrick henry : the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people , it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government -- lest it come to dominate our lives and interests . 
i ask that we restore the senate 's sunsets in the conference report .
