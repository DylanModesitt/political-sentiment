mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 because we need to support studying every kind of stem cell , from cord blood to adult to embryonic . 
parkinson 's disease affects over 1 million americans , and i am one of them . 
many people think that this is a disease that mostly affects older citizens . 
that is not true . 
i was diagnosed when i was in my mid-40s and michael j. fox , for example , was much younger than that . 
parkinson 's does not keep me from doing the things that are important to my life and my work , but parkinson 's does affect me every day of my life . 
there are good days and bad days , but there is still a need for research and for a cure . 
parkinson 's has been said to be the most curable disease that is yet to be cured . 
scientists believe a cure is on the horizon within the next 5 to 10 years . 
they also believe that the advances in parkinson 's research will lead to accelerated cures for other illnesses such as alzheimer 's . 
only embryonic stem cells hold enormous potential in order to treat these patients . 
doctors treating patients with disease or injury may feel compelled to ease the suffering by taking every ethical avenue possible to find treatments and cures . 
these doctors are among some of the most talented , dedicated , and well-respected doctors in this country . 
today we decide whether to free these scientists or to hold them captive . 
we will decide whether those suffering from parkinson 's , diabetes , spinal cord injuries , and others will have the greatest potential for cures , or whether they will just simply sit on the bench . 
mr. speaker , i do not think that is the right message to send patients and doctors . 
the american people agree . 
poll after poll has shown that a wider majority of americans support ethical embryonic stem cell research . 
the majority of bush supporters , for example , have voted to support this research . 
over 90 patient organizations , scientific and medical societies , and universities also support this research . 
some think this research has given false hope to patients like me . 
but the science is moving forward and , with our help , will go even further . 
this is really an exciting day for me , mr. speaker . 
i appreciate everyone who has helped us .
