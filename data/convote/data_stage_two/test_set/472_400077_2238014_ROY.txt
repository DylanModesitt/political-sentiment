mr. speaker , i just want to make a couple of quick points , and then i will reserve the balance of my time . 
i would disagree very strongly with my good friend from florida about the 9/11 commission . 
there were , in fact , many investigations in this congress about the tragedy that took place on 9/11 , the permanent select committee on intelligence amongst them . 
we did actually do oversight .
