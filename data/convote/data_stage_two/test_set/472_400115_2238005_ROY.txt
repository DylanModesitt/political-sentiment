mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
as i prepare to yield to my friend from charleston , let me just say that the short answer to the question posed by my friend from rochester about why it is we would not establish a commission , it is very clear . 
article 1 , section 8 of the constitution states it , that we have to do our job . 
we have the responsibility to deal with this issue . 
there are very important questions that have been raised by democrats and republicans and people from the outside community ; and we , as the representatives of the people , have the responsibility to get to the bottom of this . 
that is what the establishment of this bipartisan committee is , in fact , going to do . 
mr. speaker , i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from charleston , west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , my very good friend and hardworking member of the committee on rules .
