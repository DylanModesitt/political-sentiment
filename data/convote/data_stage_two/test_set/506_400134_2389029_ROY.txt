mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i appreciate the chairman 's efforts to reach across the aisle and produce a true bipartisan bill , and i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 for working on this . 
if any of my colleagues have served on the committee on resources , as i have , you know that this is a truly bipartisan bill . 
the gentleman from west virginia mentioned that everybody can find an example of how the current esa is out of whack , and he uses that as an excuse not to move forward with a bill that reforms it . 
i would say that that is precisely the reason we need to reform it , because everybody can find not just one but two or three or a dozen examples in their own state of how the current law is not leading to recovery , but it is , rather , tying people up and making individuals and organizations simply pay for a regulation rather than recovery . 
the purpose of this bill is to lead to the recovery of species , and that is what this is all about . 
my own state of arizona has had its own issues with the endangered species act . 
many times , those who manage water resources have been tied up with regulation that has required them to spend money on that rather than the recovery of species . 
this will make it far easier to do that . 
this bill will also mean a deal between a landowner and a federal agency is a deal . 
so for many reasons , i would support the bill .
