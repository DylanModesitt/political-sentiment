mr. speaker , i thank the leader for yielding me this time . 
i recall being taught that the mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds , and yet it grows into the mightiest of trees . 
and the same can be said of the human embryo , something so very small , so unseen by the human eye , and yet so special at the very beginning of life that it needs to be safeguarded . 
the real heart of this argument is whether something so innocent should be killed and whether americans should pay to facilitate the government-sanctioned experimentation on human life based upon a prospect , based upon a maybe , based upon a possibility , based upon the potential . 
the government already takes 285 million of our tax dollars each year and funnels it into pro-abortion organizations . 
the leadership of the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 undermines my ability to love my country , undermines our patriotism . 
i say stand fast against the secret pollsters and vote `` no '' on this legislation .
