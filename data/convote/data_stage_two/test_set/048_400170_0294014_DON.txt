mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois ( mr. evans ) xz4001260 . 
mr . 
evans . 
mr. speaker , h.r. 27 , the administration 's job training reauthorization bill , would , among other misguided actions , harm veterans ' employment programs and critical vocational rehabilitation services . 
specifically , this bill would permit states to siphon off federal resources from already underfunded veterans ' employment programs that operate under state `` one-stop '' centers . 
veterans and disabled job seekers do not deserve this . 
mr. speaker , in the 107th congress , we passed in a bipartisan manner the jobs for veterans act , legislation to reorganize , update , and improve these very same veterans ' employment and training programs . 
now is not the time for this bipartisan effort to be unraveled . 
while our troops are actively engaged in iraq and afghanistan and many others suffering from severe injuries and permanent disabilities , now is not the time to reduce the resources for these critical job training programs . 
indeed , we need to give these programs the chance to be effective . 
mr. speaker , i understand that states are facing tremendous fiscal challenges due to the harsh economic times , but clearly taking resources from one chronologically underfunded program is not the answer . 
the responsible thing for the administration to do , the right thing , would be to adequately support job seekers , especially disabled veterans , as well as to assist the states with infrastructure costs . 
mr. speaker , this legislation is not responsible and permits already modest resources intended for the nation 's disabled veterans , all who have served our country , to be further diminished . 
i oppose this legislation and urge a `` no '' vote on the underlying legislation . 
and as a former marine , i have benefitted from many programs that help veterans with education and training . 
as a continuation of those efforts , we must not let these people fall through the cracks that we have in our employment laws .
