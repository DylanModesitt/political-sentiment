mr. speaker , i am pleased to support h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
this legislation takes the critical first step in expanding the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research . 
for years , the united states has been the preeminent world leader in the field of biotechnology . 
we have made extraordinary advancements in the treatment , management and prevention of a wide range of disabilities . 
it 's nearly impossible to read a newspaper without hearing of some new breakthrough -- drug cocktails for aids patients ; gene therapy treatments ; new medical devices . 
these advancements are cause for celebration . 
our mothers and fathers , our spouses , children and grandchildren are benefiting like never before . 
they are living longer , healthier lives due to our investments in scientific research . 
much like this earlier research , the potential benefits from stem cells are almost limitless . 
and as policymakers , we have the rare opportunity to help further scientific innovation that , with the proper research and development , could produce better treatments -- or even cures -- for diseases like diabetes , parkinson 's disease , and cancer . 
despite some arguments that we have heard today , recent developments have proven that we are not far off from recognizing the true potential of this research . 
in fact , just last week , scientists in south korea successfully created the world 's first human embryonic stem cells that are patient-specific . 
this advancement was applauded around the world as a major step in the effort to produce cell-based therapies that wo n't be rejected by the body 's immune system . 
and in my home state of massachusetts , viacell and new world laboratories , two small biotech companies , have made notable progress in their research on spinal cord injuries and tissue regeneration . 
though no one can predict the outcome of embryonic stem cell research , what is certain is that without federal support , we will never fully recognize it 's potential . 
we are at a pivotal point in our nation 's history , and i hope that my colleagues will carefully consider this issue , leaving out partisan politics . 
with federal support , this research could have a real and tangible impact on millions of lives in this country . 
our nation 's current policy severely limits scientific research , and we must not continue on this dangerous course . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 810 . 
mr dingell . 
mr. speaker , i support h.r. 810 , the `` stem cell research and enhancement act of 2005. '' let us be very clear about why we are here today . 
we are here to decide whether our nation will move forward in the search for treatments and therapies that will cure a multitude of dreaded diseases that afflict an estimated 128 million americans . 
today , millions of americans suffer from alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease , spinal cord injuries or spinal dysfunction , and diabetes . 
and today , along with the tremendous number of americans living with cancer , approximately 1.5 million new cases were diagnosed in the united states last year . 
today , we can vote for h.r. 810 , and in doing so , choose to save lives and help to end the suffering of so many americans . 
stem cells are the foundation cells for every organ , tissue , and cell in the body . 
embryonic stem cells , unlike adult stem cells , possess a unique ability to develop into any type of cell . 
embryonic stem cell research holds the potential for treating a variety of diseases such as lou gehrig 's disease , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , autism , cystic fibrosis , heart disease , diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and osteoporosis , as well as spinal cord injuries . 
h.r. 810 would impose strict ethical guidelines for embryonic stem cell research and would lift the arbitrary restriction limiting funds to only some embryonic stem cell lines created before august 10 , 2001 . 
by removing this arbitrary restriction , h.r. 810 will ensure that researchers can not only continue their work to prolong or save lives , but also conduct such research using newer , less contaminated , more diverse , and more numerous embryonic stem cells . 
h.r. 810 does not allow federal funding for the creation or destruction of embryos . 
this bill only allows for research on embryonic stem cell lines retrieved from embryos created for reproductive purposes that would otherwise be discarded . 
this point is critical : if these embryos are not used for stem cell research , they will be destroyed . 
former first lady nancy reagan once said , `` science has presented us with a hope called stem cell research , which may provide our scientists with many answers that for so long have been beyond our grasp . 
i just do n't see how we can turn our backs on this . 
we have lost so much time already . 
i just really ca n't bear to lose any more. '' let us not turn our backs on this important research and the 128 million americans who could benefit from it . 
let us not lose any more time . 
let us pass h.r. 810 , the `` stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . ''
