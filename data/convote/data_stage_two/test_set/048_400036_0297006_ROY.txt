mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding . 
i pledge to work with her and other interested members of the new york delegation during conference on this legislation to identify and remedy any governance problems which new york may have under this bill . 
however , it is not clear that the language that the gentlewoman offered in committee that is included in s. 9 fixes the problem in new york and could have other unintended consequences in new york and other states . 
so my goal is to ensure that the mandatory partners contribute to the cost of the one-stop infrastructure without causing constitutional problems for states . 
and as i suggested , i will continue to work with the gentlewoman to achieve this .
