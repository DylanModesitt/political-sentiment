mr. chairman , the devastation of 9/11 shook our collective consciousness to the core ; but it should not have shattered the foundation that defines who we are as a people and serves as a beacon of individual rights and liberties throughout the world . 
our nation has been able to overcome the challenges of the past by proving to ourselves and to the world around us that our rights and our values are the indispensable conditions of being an american . 
if we allow the threat of fear and terror to undermine our civil liberties , we will have failed not only the founding fathers who bestowed upon us the philosophical foundations of this great nation , but more importantly , we will have failed the future of america as the last great hope of mankind . 
mr. chairman , an unforeseen consequence of these infringements on american citizens ' civil liberties is the erosion of our standing as the international leader of the rights of people . 
with each fundamental mistreatment of our own citizenry , we broadcast an image around the world that will , in fact , come back to haunt us . 
we will become what we deplore : a hypocritical pseudo-democracy of freedoms granted from the government down instead of from the people up . 
mr. chairman , do not rewrite our precious bill of rights . 
vote against this bill just as our founding fathers would have .
