i would just say to the gentleman who just spoke that we believe that there are many religious organizations , many faith-based organizations that do incredible work , and they will still be able to do incredible work .

it is not just a concern that those of us who are speaking here have ; i submitted a list of close to 70 civil rights and religious organizations that have objections to this provision , including the african american ministers in action ; american jewish committee ; the american jewish congress ; americans for religious liberty ; the anti-defamation league ; the baptist joint committee ; central conference of american rabbis ; episcopal church , usa ; the general board of church and society of the united methodist church ; the national advocacy center of the sisters of the good shepherd ; national council of jewish women ; network , mr. speaker , i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 .
