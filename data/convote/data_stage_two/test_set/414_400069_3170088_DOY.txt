madam speaker , as an original cosponsor of h.r. 3899 , the combat methamphetamine epidemic act , and as a committed member of the congressional caucus to fight and control methamphetamine , i rise in support of its passage , as title vii in h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 . 
i would like to thank congressman mark souder , the chief sponsor of h.r. 3889 , for his leadership in addressing our methamphetamine epidemic . 
last year , congressman souder visited my district in order to fully understand first-hand the unique challenges we in hawaii face , to hear of our efforts to keep drugs out of our homes and communities , and to see our successes in our fight against the scourge of crystal methamphetamine , ice . 
and he just returned to address the 2nd annual national methamphetamine legislative and policy conference of the national alliance for model state drug laws , congressman souder has not just talked , but acted . 
we in hawaii share many of the same concerns as others in our nation in regard to the need to support drug control , education , prevention , and treatment efforts . 
however , our geographic isolation , not only from the contiguous united states but also from our neighbor islands to the island of oahu , must be taken into account as we work to end the scourge of crystal methamphetamine . 
general drug abuse , of course , has plagued many of our communities for decades . 
to target what is needed to prevent this abuse now and in the future , we must first understand what causes it and then focus our efforts on overcoming those causes . 
and uniquely , it is up to our federal government to take the lead on the issue as it is the only entity with the resources and ability to coordinate the indispensable multi-pronged approach to stamping out drug abuse . 
title vii of h.r. 3199 is essential in our efforts to address methamphetamine trafficking , both in the united states and abroad . 
it would classify pseudoephedrine , ephedrine , and phenylpropanolamine , the major methamphetamine precursor chemicals , as `` scheduled listed chemicals. '' it would repeal the federal `` blister pack exemption '' that currently allows unlimited sales of pseudoephedrine pills . 
the bill would also require information sharing from importers on the `` chain of custody '' from foreign manufacturer to u.s. shores of methamphetamine precursor chemicals . 
title vii would also strengthen federal penalties against traffickers and smugglers . 
i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on initiatives to provide the federal resources and support we need in our fight against methamphetamine . 
mahalo , thank you , for this opportunity to express support for title vii of h.r. 3199 .
