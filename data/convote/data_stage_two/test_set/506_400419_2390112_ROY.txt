mr. chairman , first of all , to respond to my colleague from washington , a simple deed restriction takes care of that . 
they do not go through this and pay and pay and pay and pay . 
they put it in the deed when they cut the deal , and they pay fair and just compensation for taking somebody 's property . 
that would be stupid to do that over and over . 
they do that in the deed , and that is a restriction that carries with the property . 
let me talk about a couple of the differences between these two plans and why i support the underlying pombo bill . 
among other things , section 10 , page 18 , they give 3 years , the government , to come up with a recovery plan . 
our plan says 2 years . 
so if they want to recover species , we say get it done in 2 years with the recovery plan ; they say 3. if my colleagues want to talk about spending , they create a new science board . 
gs15s , section 20 in the bill , $ 1 million a year . 
cbo says we will compensate private property owners to the tune of maybe $ 6 million in the first 5 years . 
that is all they score out . 
this , $ 1 million a year for bureaucrats , and private property owners are left carrying their own costs . 
that is not fair and right in america . 
so if the members want bigger bureaucracy , pay gs15s here in washington , a total of $ 1 million combined over the year , and they get just as much as we are talking about trying to help out the private property owners . 
and if they ask the government for some sort of safe harbor for entering into a habitat conservation program , basically they get back a written determination under our provision that prevents them from being prosecuted , from the government 's coming back and double-timing them , saying , yes , go ahead and we will not prosecute if you do everything you said you were going to do . 
under the alternative , as i read it , whatever they do , they would have to get an incidental take permit and then they still do not have any kind of protection from the government 's coming back again after them . 
so what we are trying to do is create cooperative partnerships with private landowners through new conservation programs and give certainty over 10- , 20- , and 30-year periods to recover species and set up recovery programs that would come together in 2 years , not 3 , and provide for compensation when somebody loses their farm or a portion thereof just as if a highway ran through it .
