mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
i , too , come from a rural area . 
the two major industries in my district are agriculture and fishing . 
so we know the landscape and people cooperate . 
the present esa , maybe it is because we are on the east coast , the present esa bill is working fine . 
i know we need to tweak it because it does not work the same way all over the place , but i would urge my colleagues to support the substitute . 
here are some reasons why : in the substitute , there are specific criteria for science laid out . 
members want good science ; the methods , procedures , and practices are laid out . 
what species should be determined endangered , there are five criteria laid out on page 4 of the substitute . 
members should review all species that are designated every 5 years . 
we have repealed the critical habitat designations , but we have replaced it with recovery plans found on page 20 of the substitute . 
it has time frames and objective , measurable criteria . 
it has a very specific description of where that species should be recovered , and the emphasis of where that species should be recovered is not private land ; it is public land . 
the emphasis is on public land ; but whenever you go on private land , there should be some restitution , some sharing of federal dollars with those private landowners ; and 10 percent of the appropriated amount on an annual basis of this substitute will go for that very specific purpose . 
what if livestock are endangered or threatened by a reintroduced species ? 
that is taken care of . 
landowners are going to be reimbursed for that lost livestock . 
what about national security ? 
take a look at the substitute . 
there is a very specific exemption . 
page 43 of the substitute , there is a national security exemption . 
i urge my colleagues to vote for a specific , balanced esa bill . 
vote for the substitute .
