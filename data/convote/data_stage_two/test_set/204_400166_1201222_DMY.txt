mr. speaker , the promise for curing a whole host of debilitating diseases is brighter than it 's ever been . 
today , congress has the opportunity to capitalize on breakthrough scientific research to help millions across our country . 
representatives castle and degette have crafted this bill meticulously , which would allow the use of surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments and require donor consent . 
it does not allow stem cells to be sold for profit . 
this legislation takes an ethical and moral approach to a challenging subject , and throughout is respectful of the value of life . 
real political courage and leadership -- on both sides of the aisle , in the house and senate -- was required to bring us to this point . 
people from every point along the political spectrum -- from nancy reagan to the late christopher reeve -- have embraced the promise and potential of stem cell research . 
parkinson 's , cancer , alzheimer 's , juvenile diabetes , spinal cord injuries -- cures for these and other serious ailments may lie in stem cell research . 
we owe it to generations of suffering americans and their families to help find treatments that could lead to full recovery . 
many in this body like to talk about `` values. '' today , i say to them : using discarded embryos to find scientific cures for fatal diseases is our moral obligation . 
saving life is precisely what we all care about . 
mr. speaker , a vote for h.r. 810 is a vote to save lives . 
i urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan , bicameral legislation .
