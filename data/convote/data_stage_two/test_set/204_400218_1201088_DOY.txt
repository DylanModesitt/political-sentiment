mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this legislation . 
and just to be clear once again during this debate , this bill limits the use of only those embryos that will be discarded or destroyed from in vitro fertilization clinics with the consent of the donors . 
i rise in support of this legislation not because it promises cures for diabetes , parkinson 's , spinal cord injuries , alzheimer 's , but because it gives us yet another opportunity to discover cures for these ailments . 
adult stem cell research , yes , let us do it . 
cord blood research , absolutely . 
but let us also allow the federal government to get more involved in embryonic stem cell research . 
the university of wisconsin has been at the forefront of this research ; yet our researchers are being held back because of current federal policy . 
we are already falling behind the rest of the world in this research in light of south korea 's recent announcement last week . 
but it is precisely because the other countries are moving forward that makes our involvement all the more necessary . 
i believe that we as the leader of the free world must provide important leadership on the ethical parameters , the ethical constraints that this research requires . 
support this bipartisan bill .
