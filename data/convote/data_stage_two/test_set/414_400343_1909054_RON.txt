mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant opposition to this bill . 
in 2001 after an attack on the united states and the slaughter of innocent civilians , this congress passed the patriot act , which i supported at that time . 
it gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight terrorism and to win this war on terrorism . 
however , these powers were not to be permanent . 
they were designed to help us win the war , not to change our country permanently . 
now we have the patriot act being handed to us again , but instead it is being handed to us in a permanent form . 
you do not make policy for the united states government protecting the rights and freedoms of our people in an extraordinary time as this , a time of war , and then mandate it so it is going to be the rule of our country once we live in peacetime . 
our country was founded on the idea of limited government and individual liberty . 
i gladly supported patriot i. now they have taken all but two of the sunset provisions which would make those extraordinary new powers that we gave the government lapse once we have peace in this country . 
any real patriot will vote against this expansion of government at the expense of the individual even when peacetime comes .
