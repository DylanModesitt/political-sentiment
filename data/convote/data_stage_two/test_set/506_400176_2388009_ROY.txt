first let me say to the gentleman that i am very appreciative of his efforts here to make the esa a better law . 
mr. chairman , it is my understanding that the legislation would provide the president the authority to waive or expedite any provision of the act in the event of a major national disaster . 
i also understand that the legislation would require the secretary to develop regulations establishing procedures for an expedited application or waiver of the act for agency actions that would be undertaken to address threats to human health or safety .
