mr. speaker , this bill shows the courage to boldly go where none have gone before , to levels of public debt and levels of trade deficits that no nation has ever tried , higher than any have dared . 
we have a dollar that is dependent upon our fiscal markets , a trade deficit that grows every year ; and the result of this bill and its twin cousins and related siamese twins , the other parts of the republican tax and spend or borrow and spend policy , will be a declining dollar and a declining economy or a dollar that crashes and an economy that crashes . 
and this courage is all summoned up on behalf of the one quarter of 1 percent of american families it is designed to help . 
we require the men and women in uniform to risk the ultimate sacrifice ; and from our richest families , we say zero sacrifice under the estate tax . 
shame .
