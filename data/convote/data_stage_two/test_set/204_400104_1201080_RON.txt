mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i just have to respond to the comments by the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 . 
she must be reading a different bill . 
that is what this whole argument is about . 
the gentlewoman says that no federal funds can go to destroying an embryo in order to have research . 
she just said that . 
that is what this whole bill does is to allow funding of embryonic stem cell research , and in order to do that research , you have to destroy the embryo . 
in fact , if the gentlewoman would like , i would be willing to entertain a unanimous consent request that if , indeed , that does not happen in her bill , i will be glad to accept it and i will vote for the bill . 
that is the whole notion of what is going on here . 
it is not true to say that her bill does not allow federal funding for destruction of embryos . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from tennessee ( mrs. blackburn ) xz4000320 .
