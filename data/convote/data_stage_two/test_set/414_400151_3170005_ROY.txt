mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
in regard to section 215 , i want to remind the gentleman that section 215 , relating to investigators ' access to business records , this reauthorization requires a statement of fact showing reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or espionage . 
this provides additional safeguards to the original usa patriot act , which requires the government only to certify that the records at issue were sought for an authorized investigation without any factual showing . 
mr. speaker , i could continue with that , but i now yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , the distinguished chairman of the rules committee .
