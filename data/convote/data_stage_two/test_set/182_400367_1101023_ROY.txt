mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , as the gentleman has noted , there will be 5 hours of debate today . 
there will be a democrat substitute that will be included , some 200-plus pages that will allow not only full debate under these 5 hours but an opportunity for members to come down , just as the gentleman from massachusetts has done , to provide each member with information about how important this bill is . 
and i am really proud of the time that we have . 
the committee on rules did a great job . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 .
