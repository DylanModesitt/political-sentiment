mr. speaker , i am proud to vote in favor of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
this important bill brings needed reforms to our nation 's bankruptcy system . 
the legislation reduces the unfair disparity of treatment in the bankruptcy system by establishing more uniform and predictable standards . 
i am particularly pleased to note the compromise reached on healthcare and employee benefits . 
this legislation takes great strides to protect patients ' rights , and it encourages debtors and trustees to consider patients ' interests when administering healthcare bankruptcy cases . 
patients are given a voice through the appointment of an ombudsman , who advocates for the confidentiality of patients ' records and ensures patients are transferred to appropriate facilities . 
these are critical provisions that protect the rights of those with failing health . 
i would like to commend a constituent from my district for his contributions to this legislation , keith j. shapiro , esq. , of northbrook , illinois , and his colleague nancy a. peterman , esq . 
mr. shapiro testified in support of these patient health provisions before the u.s. senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts on june 1 , 1998 . 
the passing of this legislation marks the culmination of mr. shapiro and ms. peterman 's tireless efforts to protect patients ' interests in bankruptcy cases . 
on behalf of my colleagues in congress , i offer my sincere gratitude for their dedication to fair bankruptcy policy .
