mr. speaker , we will be hearing a great deal today about the humane and helpful and hopeful research of embryonic stem cells . 
this is an advance similar to advances in past years of blood transfusions and organ transplants . 
and to be fair , some patients do not want to take part in blood transfusions and organ transplants for personal reasons . 
however , for most americans , embryonic stem cell research falls well within public ethical standards . 
it is something that we should be supporting . 
we will hear from some today that cord blood and adult stem cells hold promise . 
not nearly so much promise as embryonic stem cells . 
supporting cord blood research at the expense of supporting embryonic stem cell research is like buying a schwinn bicycle to travel across the country . 
potentially useful , but it is not likely to get us there . 
this is something that is well within the public ethical norms . 
we should be supporting h.r. 810 .
