mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to represent new jersey , one of the few states that devotes its own resources to embryonic stem cell research . 
to help us understand this humane line of research , let us look at in vitro fertilization . 
several decades ago , many people raised concerns about this procedure ; everywhere there were attacks using the term `` test tube babies. '' but today there are 400 , 000 young people who are the products of in vitro fertilization , and in every case , there are eggs , fertilized eggs , that were not brought to full-term birth . 
but people do not condemn the use of ivf . 
and just as we do not place ethical burdens on the children who were conceived through ivf , we should not place ethical burdens on the millions of americans suffering from parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , diabetes , et cetera . 
i am hoping that several decades from today , we will look back and find ourselves thankful that we came to a humane , prudent conclusion . 
embryonic stem cell research will have yielded new ways to diagnose , treat , and cure tragic diseases . 
i urge my colleagues to support the humane h.r. 810 .
