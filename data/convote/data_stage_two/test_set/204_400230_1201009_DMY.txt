mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 , and i want to acknowledge the bipartisan effort that has gone into this legislation and the incredible grass roots movement that has built support for this groundbreaking medical research . 
it has been inspirational to see so many members putting aside politics and partisanship to address this issue which affects the lives of millions of americans . 
mr. speaker , i am one of those americans . 
at age 16 , i was an explorer scout in my hometown police station . 
one afternoon , in the police locker room , a gun accidentally discharged . 
the bullet severed my spinal cord , and i have been paralyzed ever since . 
this experience shapes my perspective in so many ways . 
above all , it has given me tremendous appreciation and respect for life . 
my life as a quadriplegic is filled with challenges and obstacles , yet i am grateful for every minute . 
this gratitude has become a passion , and it has motivated me to help create a culture that values and protects life from its beginning to its end . 
to me , being pro-life also means fighting for policies that will eliminate pain and suffering and help people enjoy longer , healthier lives . 
and to me , support for embryonic stem cell research is entirely consistent with that position . 
what could be more life-affirming than using what otherwise would be discarded to save , extend , and improve countless lives ? 
this research offers the opportunity to discover cures and treatments for diseases like parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , als , diabetes , spinal cord injury , and many others . 
but it will take not only the talent of our scientists , but also the support of our government to realize its full potential . 
we have a responsibility to ensure that this research proceeds , and it does so with ethical safeguards and strict guidelines . 
by permitting research only on excess embryos created in the in-vitro fertilization process , and by establishing a clear , voluntary consent process for donors , h.r. 810 meets this responsibility . 
stem cell research gives us hope and a reason to believe . 
i believe one day a child with diabetes will no longer face a lifetime of painful shots and tests . 
i believe one day families will no longer watch in agony as a loved one with parkinson 's or alzheimer 's gradually declines . 
and i believe one day i will walk again . 
there are few moments in medical history when we can clearly identify a giant step forward in improving countless lives . 
we saw it with the discovery of antibiotics and the advent of organ transplants . 
mr. speaker , i believe that adult and embryonic stem cell research is another of these great moments . 
today we have a historic opportunity to make a difference in the lives of millions of americans and for people around the world . 
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 810 .
