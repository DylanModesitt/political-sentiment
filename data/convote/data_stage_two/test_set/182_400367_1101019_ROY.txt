mr. speaker , we spoke earlier about how members provided information back and forth not only to the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and the homeland security department but also about how we were able to have a committee on rules meeting yesterday with thoughtful ideas that were presented yesterday . 
our next speaker was a part of those thoughtful ideas . 
he not only sat through hours of testimony , quizzing members about their questions and comments , things that would make things better , but also a few ideas himself . 
mr. speaker , i am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 .
