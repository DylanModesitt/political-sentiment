mr. speaker , i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 810 . 
this bill , which we have already heard today , would reverse the embryonic stem cell policy instituted by the president of the united states in 2001 , and i believe it is very misguided , in my opinion . 
i wish to thank the majority leader , the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 , and the gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 for their work on this legislation against h.r. 810 . 
they have already outlined many of the reasons why the bill should be defeated , but i would like to share some additional thoughts . 
first , let me say that good people can disagree on this issue . 
however , what we are discussing today is the federal funding of the embryonic stem cell . 
according to the statement of administration policy this morning , the administration strongly opposes passage of h.r. 810 . 
the bill would compel all american taxpayers to pay for research that relies on the intentional destruction of human embryos to obtain stem cells , overturning the president 's policy that supports research without promoting ongoing destruction . 
there are other vast financial resources available to fund this controversial issue . 
therefore , i urge my colleagues to vote against and not allow embryos to be killed for federal funding research that is ethically and scientifically uncertain .
