mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me , and i commend the gentleman for his leadership on this issue . 
we have heard a lot of discussion of the three known forms of stem cell therapies that are hypothesized to treat all these diseases . 
one of the nice things about adult stem cell treatments and why i think they have been embraced , and part of the reason they have been so successful is , if you use a cell from your own body , there are no tissue rejection concerns . 
if you use a cord blood or placental blood stem cell , there are tissue rejection concerns ; but it is felt by the advocates of the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith 's ) bill , such as myself , that by obtaining the bank , we would be able to enter all of your genetic information and come up with a match . 
and one of the questions i have for my colleagues who have been an advocate for the castle/degette bill is , how , if these embryonic cells were ever proven to be useful , and that has yet to be demonstrated in the literature , how would you override the tissue rejection concerns ? 
mr. speaker , it takes us to a very important part of this debate that we really have not dwelled on very much . 
they say there are 400 , 000 embryos in the freezers , but the truth is the vast majority of those embryos are wanted , and their own studies suggest only 275 cell lines will be available if this bill becomes law . 
mr. speaker , the place we are going to have to go to make embryonic stem cell work , if it ever can be demonstrated to work , is creating human embryos for this purpose . 
and that really brings me to my point . 
if you are going to go down the road of creating human embryos , you really only have two options . 
you are going to need tens of thousands of women to donate their eggs , or you are going to have to clone . 
and that is why people like myself have been saying , wait to see what is next , because that is going to be the next debate . 
if this becomes law , we are going to be asked to embrace federal funding for creating human life for this research . 
no longer using the so-called excess embryos , but either exploiting women for their eggs or worse , we are going down the path of cloning . 
and i assure you , if you find those options objectionable , they will be cloaked with the same kind of arguments that have been used to support this bill . 
people will say it is for the purpose of helping the sick and suffering . 
and what i have been saying over and over again , if you actually read the medical journals , the promise and the potential appear to be in the ethically acceptable alternatives of adult stem research and cord blood research . 
reject this bill . 
vote `` no '' on castle/degette .
