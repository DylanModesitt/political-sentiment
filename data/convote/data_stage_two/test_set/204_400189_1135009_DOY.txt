i thank the leader . 
i know that our leader and your office are working on that unanimous consent and the parameters of the consideration of , as you point out , a very , very important bill . 
there are obviously different points of view on the legislation . 
i know we are going to be meeting monday night and going to come in early tuesday . 
would you have a thought as to when , because of the importance of this bill , our members want to be sure that they are here , as i am sure yours do as well , what time of day you would expect to be considering that piece of legislation ?
