mr. speaker , i thank the leader for yielding me this time . 
i ask myself this question : if we are going to deal with this debate on embryonic stem cell research , what are the ethics of this ? 
one can go to google and do a google search on permissible medical experiments . 
and i did that , and i found that there is a list of 10 things that have to be qualifiers for permissible medical experiments on human beings . 
one is the subject must be a volunteer . 
the second one is there must be no alternative . 
the third one is results of animal experimentation must be proven successful prior to their experiments . 
the net result in death or disability can not be accepted . 
the seventh one is there can not be even a remote possibility of injury , disability , or death . 
the human subject must be at liberty to end the experiment . 
and the likely result can not be injury , disability , or death . 
the exception is if a physician wants to experiment upon himself . 
where do i find this information , mr. speaker ? 
i find this information in the military tribunals under control council law no .
