mr. speaker , i yield myself 2 minutes . 
mr. speaker , i want to clarify something . 
i am actually not sure that those who oppose this bill understand what this bill really does . 
in 1995 , two members of congress , mr. dickey and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. wicker ) xz4004320 , inserted language in the appropriations bill , which is there every year and has been there every year i have been in congress , and it says : `` no federal funds shall be used to create or destroy embryos. '' now , those on the other side of this debate say they do not think federal funds should be used for this research , even though by their own admission the majority of americans support this research . 
and so here is what this bill does , and maybe once i explain it , everyone will want to vote for it . 
what it says is , people who go to in vitro fertilization clinics , there are leftover embryos as part of the process . 
they can decide one of two things : number one , do they want to not discard the embryos and either donate them to other couples , and they can be these snowflake children , or to store them in a freezer ? 
or the donors can decide if they want to throw them away . 
or do they want to donate them to science ? 
it is their decision with informed consent . 
now , if they decide to donate them , then what would happen would be the embryos would go to a clinic where a stem cell line would be developed from the embryo with private funds . 
no federal funds . 
the only federal funds used under the castle/degette bill are federal funds to then develop those embryonic stem cell lines . 
just as the president 's executive order in august of 2001 allowed stem cell lines to be researched with federal funding , but he limited those lines , we are allowing more of those lines . 
so no embryos will be destroyed with federal funds . 
i hope that clarifies the situation . 
mr. speaker , i am now delighted to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. maloney ) xz4002510 .
