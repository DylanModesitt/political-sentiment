mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , i say to my chairman , i appreciate his concluding comments there and , as i have said all along , we have negotiated in good faith , and i do want to continue that relationship that we have . 
maybe we can still work on this bill together ; i hope we can . 
but we will see as the process goes forward . 
mr. chairman , how much time do i have left ?
