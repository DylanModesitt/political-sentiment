mr. speaker , as stewards of hard-working americans ' tax dollars , we can not ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos . 
like the rest of my colleagues joining me today , i am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life . 
but to fund federal research on stem cells derived from killing human embryos is unethical and irresponsible . 
while stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector , president bush permitted the usage of embryonic stem cell lines sufficient for extensive government-funded research nearly 4 years ago . 
in these 4 years , government and private research on those stem cells have produced nothing , cured no one ; and there is no indication that that will change . 
in the meantime , ethical research not derived from embryos in the public and private sectors has helped cure almost 60 diseases . 
the private sector has proven the superiority and promise of cord blood in adult stem cell research by choosing to fund those areas . 
let us learn from their example and not squander taxpayer dollars on unethical research . 
mr. speaker , we do have the power of the purse , and we can not misuse it by funding the slaughter of human life .
