mr. speaker , i did not say the bill did not pay for service members ' medical expenses who are injured in iraq or afghanistan . 
i said if they incur debt after they come back from serving this country and are forced to bankruptcy , they get the punitive means test . 
that is wrong . 
we should not do it to people serving in iraq and afghanistan .
