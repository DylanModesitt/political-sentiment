mr. speaker , i rise today in support of this bill and all of the promise that comes with funding embryonic stem cell research . 
this bill represents an important step forward for the scientific and medical communities in our country , offering hope to the millions of americans who suffer from diseases that stem cell therapies may be able to cure . 
unfortunately , president bush has threatened to veto this bill when it arrives on his desk . 
i am appalled that a president who talks so much about embracing a `` culture of life '' would deny funding for a possible cure that could save a child from suffering from juvenile diabetes ; repair a damaged spinal cord to allow a person to walk again ; save a grandparent from the onset of alzheimer 's disease ; or put a halt to the ravages of parkinson 's disease . 
the potential benefits from embryonic stem cell research are almost boundless and would certainly touch the life of a friend or family member of everyone in america . 
mr. bush 's ban on providing federal funds for stem cell research has seriously damaged our nation 's efforts to be a leading voice in the development of this new technology . 
allowing federal funding for research on stem cells is vital to making real progress as quickly as possible to find real cures . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that will certainly have long-lasting effects in improving the health and well being of millions of americans .
