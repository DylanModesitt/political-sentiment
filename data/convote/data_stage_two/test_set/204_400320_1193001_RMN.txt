mr. speaker , i am a big supporter of stem cell research . 
but i do not support the dissecting and destruction of living human embryos to do so . 
steve johnson from reading , pennsylvania , agrees with me . 
a bicycle incident , an accident , he had 11 years ago replaced his bike with a wheelchair . 
he has heard that embryonic stem cells might help him walk again . 
for steve , though , that is unacceptable , using embryos . 
the way that h.r. 810 would find those cells is through the destruction of ivf living embryos . 
he and his wife , kate , adopted his daughter , zara , as an embryo from an ivf clinic when she was just a frozen embryo . 
and h.r. 810 would have killed zara as an embryo for her stem cells . 
there are 20 others like this child here in town today -- the `` snowflakes '' -- babies who developed from embryos given by their biological parents to a couple unable to conceive on their own . 
if h.r. 810 were law , there is a good chance they would not be here at all . 
they are living human embryos , and there are many of them that should be adopted , not dissected . 
the sad thing is that steve is more likely to be treated not with embryonic stem cell research but with stem cells from his own body . 
adult stem cell treatments are helping people walk today , in 67 different diseases and treatments . 
the proponents of h.r. 810 can produce no such results . 
there are none for embryonic stem cells .
