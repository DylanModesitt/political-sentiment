mr. chairman , i too rise in support of this bill . 
we have had some great debate , 11 hearings , and i appreciate my friend the gentleman from massachusetts ' point about section 215 , but the gentleman from florida ( mr. feeney ) xz4001310 is right . 
i mean , library records are being used as a red herring . 
we have seen over and over that libraries have been used by terrorists and this will help address that . 
the thing is so far that provision of 215 has not been used with regard to libraries . 
but if a terrorist is using that information , as a former judge , i would not hesitate if the information were there , raising probable cause . 
but there are safeguards in 215 . 
there is a court . 
there is a judge reviewing . 
i was terribly concerned about the right to an attorney not being in there . 
that is being amended to include that . 
i was concerned about not having a provision for appealing that power under 215 . 
that has been added and amended . 
and so we are coming to a great bill here , and it has come about through great debate , back and forth . 
and i would also point out though , with regard to the london bombings and the further activity today , you know , our hearts and prayers go out to our friends across the ocean . 
but we can not lose sight of the fact either , we have not had one yet here , not since 9/11 . 
and if you are in a position to review top secret records , you will see that this has been used effectively . 
and as far as 215 and the passion my friend , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , had about we have got to have a sunset , good news . 
the sunset is in here for 206 and 215 . 
so i am proud to rise in support . 
i have had great concerns about some areas . 
they are being addressed . 
we do have some sunsets to provide some protection , and i am proud that this administration has not abused any of these until we can get these holes filled .
