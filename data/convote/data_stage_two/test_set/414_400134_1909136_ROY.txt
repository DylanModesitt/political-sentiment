mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute . 
i just wanted to say that the gentleman from indiana ( mr. pence ) xz4003150 brought up the point that the buck stops here , and that is what we are really trying to do with the fbi director , to ensure that that person is in charge and there is less likely to be a fishing expedition by a lower-ranking official . 
when you combine that with what we already have in law , which is a requirement that the fbi director report to congress every 6 months about the use of this statute , you really have a strong provision and strong protections . 
think of it : you have the fbi director himself , or herself , saying , i want to use this authority for this specific purpose , and then having to report that every 6 months to congress . 
i think we really have curtailed the possibility for abuse . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
