mr. chairman , i rise to explain my decision to vote against this version of the patriot act . 
this has not been an easy decision . 
some of the provisions that are being reauthorized in this bill provide law enforcement officials with important tools that may be helpful in detecting and disrupting terrorist activities . 
i support those provisions . 
other provisions , however , fail to provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the privacy rights of innocent citizens are protected . 
it is very important that , in our effort to defend the liberties that americans cherish , we not enact measures that erode the very freedoms we seek to protect . 
we can ensure that the government has the necessary surveillance powers without sacrificing the privacy rights in the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 , it is essential that we strengthen our ability to detect , deter , and disrupt terrorist activities . 
many provisions in the patriot act accomplish this objective in a balanced way . 
other provisions , however , leave citizens vulnerable to unchecked , unwarranted , and potentially abusive invasions of privacy . 
i am hopeful that the senate will address these shortcomings in the house bill so that , at the end of the day , we can enact a balanced bill that protects both our security and the rights and liberties we seek to secure . 
we can do better . 
i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues -- both democrats and republicans -- to develop a bill of which we can all be proud and which can be a true testament to american patriots and to the constitution we all seek to uphold and defend .
