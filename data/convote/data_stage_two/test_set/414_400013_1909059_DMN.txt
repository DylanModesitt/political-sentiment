mr. chairman , i rise today to oppose h.r. 3199 . 
as the gentleman just mentioned , i was a member of the committee on the judiciary on september 11 , 2001 . 
and in the weeks that followed , i joined my colleagues in committee to carefully craft a bill to give law enforcement personnel additional and powerful tools to fight terror . 
but as many of you recall , the work product of our committee was rejected at the eleventh hour in favor of a far more expansive act which has continued to raise concerns among those who cherish our constitutional liberties . 
through the patriot act and other anti-terrorism measures , we have become a country that permits secret surveillance , secret searches , denial of court review , monitoring of conversations between citizens and their attorneys , and searching of library and medical records of citizens . 
this does not sound like america to me . 
mr. chairman , reauthorization of this act is an opportunity ; it is an opportunity to restore the checks and balances that must exist in a free society . 
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' to allow us that chance .
