mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to speak on behalf of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
today there have been bills presented that discuss , among other things , the merits of embryonic stem cell study versus cord blood cell utilization . 
this discussion , while interesting , misses the point of promoting stem cell research in general : scientific breakthroughs that may originate from stem cell examination have the power to better , and even save the lives of our fellow citizens afflicted with terrible diseases . 
stem cell research holds out hope for those suffering with , for example , diabetes , parkinson 's , and coronary heart disease , the number one killer of adults in this country . 
we must encourage this research , and the legislation offered by my colleagues from new jersey and delaware is an important step forward in our attempts to find cures for these diseases . 
moreover , the stem cell research enhancement act promotes the establishment of ethical standards with regard to the procurement of embryos utilized in the research . 
the only embryos that can be utilized are ones that were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need . 
further , the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom those embryos were created have determined that these embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will be otherwise discarded . 
finally , these same individuals have provided written consent for embryo donation . 
the development of standards , both ethical and clinical , is an important aspect of stem cell research . 
this bill directs that the national institutes of health develop guidelines to insure that researchers adhere to the highest possible principles in scientific inquiry . 
here we have a unique opportunity to establish national standards that will become the benchmark for scientific study throughout the world . 
by encouraging scientific breakthroughs while at the same time observing the highest possible standards of ethical and clinical behavior , we can go a long way towards battling genetically-based diseases that have ended the lives of so many . 
thank you mr. speaker , and i yield back the balance of my time .
