mr. speaker , what the gentleman suggested was , if someone has overwhelming medical bills , hundreds of thousands in medical bills , that they can file under chapter 7. that is not true . 
if they have a job and they have $ 100 a month left over after essential expenses , they are going to have to go under a wage earner plan for the next 5 years . 
every dime they have got after food and rent will go to all of their bills . 
they can not file under chapter 7 .
