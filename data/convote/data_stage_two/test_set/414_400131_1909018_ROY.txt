mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me time . 
mr. chairman , i note that since the 9/11 attacks , in part we all know due to the patriot act , there have been no new attacks on america . 
i also think americans ought to know there is a bookstore in london , in the leeds section , called the iqra bookstore ; and among the books that iqra learning center sells are extremist muslim materials . 
we now believe that three out of four of the terrorists that attacked london 2 weeks ago and killed 56 people visited frequently this bookstore . 
if the british authorities had known about the possible link and had a 215 clause , the main clause being attacked by the opponents of the patriot act , perhaps there would be 56 people alive today . 
so all the scare tactics can be done away with , all the hysterical allegations . 
every american needs to know that this 215 , which has been referred to as the library provision , nowhere mentions libraries . 
but what 215 does do is say a federal judge must make findings before any warrant would ever be issued . 
this can only affect non-americans in the first place , or americans would only be affected if there is an ongoing terrorism or intelligence investigation . 
mr. chairman , every american needs to know that unless there is an ongoing terror or intelligence investigation , unless a judge makes a decision , no american can ever be affected . 
to the extent that we want to create safe harbors , either in bookstores or libraries or anywhere else by eliminating 215 , we ought to be candid with americans . 
we ought to be candid about the fact that we expect and are going to sit back as london-type bombings take place on our subways and bus systems . 
we may not be able to prevent the next attack , but as long as americans ' liberties are protected by a judge ahead of time , as long as this is a reasonable provision affecting only non-americans or during an intelligence or ongoing terrorism investigation , it is absolutely appropriate . 
i would not be doing my duty as a congressman to not fight for 215 to be reenacted . 
we have added some protections . 
everybody who receives one of these warrants is guaranteed to see a lawyer , and , if they want to , challenge the warrant .
