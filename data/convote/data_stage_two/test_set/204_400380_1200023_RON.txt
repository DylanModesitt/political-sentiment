mr. speaker , i just want to make the point that some misinformation perhaps inadvertently is being spread on this floor , that these stem cells that are derived from cord blood only have a blood application . 
that is unmitigated nonsense . 
it is not true . 
and i pointed out in my opening comments that in the celgene cellular therapeutics first reported back in 2001 that placental stem cells turned into nerve , blood , cartilage , skin and muscle cells , and that since that time other studies have confirmed cord blood 's pluripotent capability . 
surely there needs to be further research .
