mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
the gentleman is passionate about his concern for the fiscal well-being , but he is clearly misdirected in the sense that he will have an opportunity to vote on a number of these deficit reduction measures , a number of these savings , a number of these government reform mechanisms ; and he will have the opportunity to present all of the things that he talked about in his own recommittal motion , which is a right that has been granted to the minority party . 
so all of the things that he talked about , all of the things that he objects to , the sound agricultural policy that guarantees that we continue to have the safest , cheapest food supply in the world , if you want to cut those things , you can put it in your program . 
if you do not like the fact that we are taking pell grants up , you could object to that through your recommittal motion . 
the point is that we are here today debating the rule on the continuing resolution of the government because we have three regular order appropriations bills yet to move , because i believe , to our credit and to this chamber 's credit , to the credit of the entire house , we are not moving a last minute omnibus choo-choo train that all of us have to go home and then discover something in that that we are not real terribly proud of . 
i think it is a credit to the appropriators on both sides of the aisle and a credit , frankly , to both chambers , and as the gentleman from florida has pointed out , under republican leadership , that are bringing us 11 individual appropriations bills that can be voted on up or down . 
you have an opportunity to make your position publicly known on each of those bills , rather than having things stuffed into a last-minute train , which all of us object to and which diminishes the status of the house . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
