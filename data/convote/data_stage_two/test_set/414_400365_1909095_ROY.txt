mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time . 
after listening to the speech of the distinguished minority leader , i have reached the conclusion she has not read the bill . 
she has not looked at the oversight that the committee on the judiciary has done over the last 3 1/2 years . 
we have an oversight record of bipartisan letters sent to the justice department , inspector general 's reports , and hearings that have a stack of paper that is about 2 feet high . 
in this bill we have had 12 hearings with 35 witnesses , people who have come from all over the spectrum ; and 13 of the 16 sections of the patriot act that are sunsetted are not controversial . 
the three controversial sections , two of them are sunsetted ; the third one , as a result of some of the testimony , has been amended , and that is the delayed notification warrants . 
the fact of the matter remains that no federal court has found that any of the 16 sunsetted sections are unconstitutional , and the inspector general , who is required by the patriot act itself to report to the congress twice a year , has not found any civil liberties violations . 
let us stick to the facts . 
let us stick to the result of the oversight . 
let us stop the hyperbole . 
and let us stop the scare tactics that seem to surround the debate of those who are opposed to this law for whatever purpose .
