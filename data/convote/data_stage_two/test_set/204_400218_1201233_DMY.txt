mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
this bill would expand the current federal policy on embryonic stem cell research by allowing federally funded research on stem cell lines derived after august 9 , 2001 , while implementing strong ethical guidelines to ensure federal oversight of the research . 
most of the scientific community believes that for the full potential of embryonic stem cell research to be reached , the number of cell lines readily available to scientists must increase . 
just last month , a number of nih directors testified before the senate appropriations committee that the current policy is restrictive and hinders scientific progress . 
we are already at risk of losing our scientific and technological edge because of increasing competition around the world . 
other countries -- such as china , india , and the united kingdom -- are forging ahead with embryonic stem cell research because of less restrictive policies . 
india , for example , has an extensive stem cell regulatory system , yet allows the derivation of new stem cells from surplus embryos at fertility clinics . 
our restrictive policy not only puts us at risk of losing our scientific edge , we are also at risk of losing some of the best american scientists to other countries where policies are less restrictive . 
important advances in the science of embryonic stem cell research have been made since the august 2001 policy was set . 
earlier this year , researchers at the university of wisconsin in madison figured out how to grow human embryonic stem cells without using mouse feeder cells . 
this is exciting news since mouse feeder cells are thought to be a source of contamination if the cells are ever to be used therapeutically in humans . 
from its earliest days , stem cell research has been important to the people of wisconsin . 
in fact , dr . 
james thomson , a researcher at the university of wisconsin , was the first to isolate and culture embryonic stem cells . 
in 2003 , this esteemed researcher received the frank annunzio award , given to recognize the innovative research of american scientists who devote their careers to improving the lives of people through their work in science . 
wisconsin has been at the forefront of embryonic stem cell research from the beginning . 
this legislation is essential to make sure the important work of our scientists is not unnecessarily sidetracked by politics . 
but this legislation is not only important because of the potential for advances in science and technology . 
more important is the fact that embryonic stem cell research could lead to new treatments and cures for the many americans afflicted with life-threatening and debilitating diseases . 
scientists believe these cells could be used to treat many diseases , including alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , diabetes , and spinal cord injuries . 
however , the promise of this research may not be reached if the federal policy is not expanded . 
mr. speaker , it has become increasingly clear that the american public supports expanding the federal stem cell policy . 
just yesterday , results from a survey of wisconsin voters were released showing overwhelming support for embryonic stem cell research . 
nearly two-thirds of those polled support expanding federal policies to support more research -- regardless of party affiliation . 
i strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation that will allow science to move forward unimpeded , has the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine , and can offer hope to the millions of americans suffering from debilitating diseases .
