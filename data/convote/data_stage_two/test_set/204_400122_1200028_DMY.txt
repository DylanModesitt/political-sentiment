mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from ohio ( mr. brown ) xz4000501 for yielding time to me . 
and i rise in support of h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 . 
this act , combined with h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , will go a long way towards helping millions of americans who suffer from debilitating health conditions . 
i wholeheartedly support umbilical stem cell research , but also support embryonic stem cell research . 
as anyone who suffers from diabetes , parkinson 's disease , als , or a host of other health problems knows , one possible treatment is the use of stem cells to help regrow the tissues affected by their ailments . 
scientists have stated that embryonic stem cells provide the best opportunity for devising unique treatments of these serious diseases since , unlike adult stem cells , they may be induced to develop into any type of cell . 
adult stem cells are also problematic , as they are difficult to identify , purify and grow , and simply may not exist for certain diseased tissues that need to be replaced . 
please understand that i do not discount the promise of adult stem cell research or cord blood research , but i agree with the national institutes of health that we must carefully study all types of adult and embryonic stem cells . 
in their words , `` given the enormous promise of stem cell therapies for so many devastating diseases , nih believes that it is important to simultaneously pursue all lines of research. '' our loved ones deserve science 's best hope for the future . 
now , i want to say something . 
this is not about cloning . 
i oppose cloning of human beings . 
this is about the use of embryonic stem cells which would have been discarded anyway . 
i want to repeat that . 
this is about the use of embryonic stem cells which would have been discarded anyway . 
it has been estimated that there are currently 400 , 000 frozen ivf embryos , which would be destroyed if they are not donated for research . 
i would never condone the donation of embryos to science without the informed , written consent of donors and strict regulations prohibiting financial remuneration for potential donors . 
our nation 's scientific research must adhere to the highest ethical standards . 
but it is important that we do embryonic stem cell research . 
we are falling behind other countries , and this is not what ought to be happening . 
president bush has limited federal funding of stem cell research to only those stem cell lines that existed prior to august of 2001 . 
but unfortunately , only 22 cell lines are available for study , which prevents scientists from having access to important genetic cell diversity . 
simply put , if it continues , that would not be ethical . 
please support both bills .
