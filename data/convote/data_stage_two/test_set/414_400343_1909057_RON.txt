i would suggest that we do not have to sunset all the legislation going through this congress , but we have to pay particular attention to that legislation that affects the civil liberties of our people . 
and if we are going to in some way expand the power of government over our people in time of war because it is necessary , that should be sunsetted once the war is over . 
by permanently changing america , we are not furthering the cause of freedom in this country .
