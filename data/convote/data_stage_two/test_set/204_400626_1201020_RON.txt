mr. speaker , as a physician , i know that respected scientists believe that misrepresentations and exaggerated claims in this debate are not only scientifically irresponsible , they are deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures . 
it seems to me that there is one unmistakable fact . 
many in our society have sincere , heartfelt , passionate , ethical questions , worthy of our respect , regarding the scientific or medical use of embryonic stem cells . 
if our goal is truly to cure diseases and help patients , science tells us that today the use of adult and cord stem cells has successfully treated or holds real potential for treating nearly 60 diseases . 
the same can not be said for embryonic stem cells , and adult stem cells carry none of the ethical questions or dilemma of embryonic stem cells . 
i support stem cell research , active , aggressive and scientifically based , with respect for the difficult ethical questions we face today . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in respecting science , in respecting ethical concerns . 
if we do , we will recognize that stem cell research and treatment of disease should actively proceed with those adult and cord stem cells that are providing and will increasingly provide excellent and exciting cures for patients in need .
