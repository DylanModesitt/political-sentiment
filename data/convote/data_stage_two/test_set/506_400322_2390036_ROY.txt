mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i look forward to the gentleman 's opposition to the highway bill and any new purchases of land , to the wildlife refuge system , to the park system , or any other thing that we spend money on , because he sees it as a big giveaway , a big government giveaway system . 
again , what the underlying bill does is if you step in and take habitat from a private property owner and you tell them that you restrict them and you tell them they can not use part of their property , then we set up a system of incentives and grants . 
but , if in the end , the secretary says your property is necessary for the recovery of an endangered species , therefore you can not use it , we compensate them for that and we pay them for it . 
if we build a highway across somebody 's property , even though that may increase the value of the rest of the property , we pay them for it . 
if we take part of their property for a wildlife refuge , even though that may increase the value of the rest of their property , we pay them for it . 
but , if we take their property for endangered species habitat , we tell them , you are out of luck . 
now i have guys coming down here saying , this is a big , new giveaway system , that we are going to give away things to people . 
no . 
this is a big takeaway . 
you are taking away from them . 
you have been doing it for 30 years . 
now it is time to pay for it . 
you are taking land away from people . 
every little small farmer , rancher across the country , every homeowner across the country who has had their property taken away from them should be compensated for it . 
you are taking away their land . 
there is nothing wrong with that .
