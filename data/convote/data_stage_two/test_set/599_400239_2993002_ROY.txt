mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i do not intend to consume much time at all . 
this is a continuing resolution that simply includes a change of date extending our work through december 17 in order to give the president and others enough time to review these conference reports and other pieces of legislation being sent to the administration in rapid fire . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
