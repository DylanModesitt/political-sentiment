mr. speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds . 
mr. speaker , i just want to remind my colleagues that prior to 9/11 and before the usa patriot act in 2001 , we had this culture and legal problem where law enforcement could not communicate whatsoever with intelligence . 
this bill enabled us to finally , finally connect the dots . 
i think this is very important for all of us to keep in mind . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from tennessee ( mr. wamp ) xz4004210 , a member of the appropriations committee .
