mr. speaker , we are all different . 
we are all different because we each have our own dna . 
the ordering of genes in our body makes us unique . 
we have the color of our hair , skin , eyes , teeth , because of dna . 
and each person has his or her own set of dna , and that makes us each unique . 
each and every person is valuable . 
i am a supporter of ethical stem cell research , mr. speaker . 
i do not support the dissecting and destruction of living human embryos to harvest stem cells for the purpose of experimentation and research , and that is because each of these living human embryos has its own genetic makeup , its own dna . 
it is not animal dna . 
it is not plant dna . 
it is human genetic code , human dna . 
the stuff that sets each person apart is there in this tiny little life that h.r. 810 would destroy . 
each unique and distinct , but frozen . 
early today i met with a man , steve johnson , from reading , pennsylvania , who is in washington for this debate . 
steve was in a bicycle accident 11 years ago and his bike was replaced with a wheelchair , and today steve is a paraplegic . 
and he has heard the promises made that embryonic stem cell research might help him walk again . 
for steve , though , that is unacceptable . 
and so steve and his wife , kate , adopted a little girl . 
here are three little snowflake babies . 
he adopted little zara when she was just a frozen embryo , stored at an ivf clinic . 
she was a leftover embryo that proponents of this bill would destroy for her cells . 
if someone had dissected her for embryonic stem cell research , she would not be here today . 
but she is here today with 21 other little snowflake children . 
steve would not have his daughter because scientists want a laboratory experiment . 
zara is living proof that advocates of h.r. 810 are wrong on this issue . 
what they do not admit is that steve johnson 's paralysis is more likely to be reversed using adult stem cells . 
how do we know that ? 
because recently , we learned that cells taken from a person 's nose , olfactory cells , are helping people walk again . 
cells taken from cord blood are helping people walk again , today . 
embryonic stem cells , no , not helping people walk again . 
they might say there is hope . 
there is no proof . 
i would like to challenge the other side to put up in front of a camera one person treated for spinal cord injury with embryonic stem cells . 
you can not , can you ? 
we can . 
hwang mi-soon , susan fajt . 
how about parkinson 's ? 
you can not . 
we can . 
dennis turner . 
how about cancer ? 
leukemia ? 
sickle cell ? 
you can not . 
adult stem cells are treating human patients today for the very diseases that the proponents of this bill claim might hopefully one day be treated through the destruction of living human embryos . 
the human being is in all stages of development , or disability , uniquely distinct and infinitely valuable . 
house resolution 810 is a tragic betrayal of that value .
