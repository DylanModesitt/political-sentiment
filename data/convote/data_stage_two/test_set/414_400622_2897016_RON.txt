madam speaker , first of all i want to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague from california and also to state for the record that i support the motion to instruct . 
i also would like to thank the chairman for his comments today regarding the motion to instruct . 
i ran on a platform of freedom like most people did in this congress . 
and i believe it was ronald reagan , and i am paraphrasing , who said freedom is a fragile thing that must be defended by each generation . 
and that is what i am here to do . 
that is what i am here to do today . 
i believe that we ought to look for other or additional sections of this bill to sunset , but i am happy to see that this congress is taking a hard look at the provisions and the sections that have already been mentioned to ensure that the freedoms that our families enjoy and the people in this country enjoy so much will be protected . 
i also understand the arguments that have been made about the oversight of the committee ; and , mr. chairman , i know that as the chair of that committee that will be done . 
my concern is for future generations and to make sure that none of the freedoms that americans enjoy today will ever be taken away from them in the future .
