mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. speaker , i just wanted to point out that it has been said that there are 100 , 000 embryos available for research . 
i guess they want to add another portion to their bill requiring parents to give their embryos up for research because at the present time there are only 2.8 percent of the parents that have allowed or have designated their embryos to be used for research . 
that means there are only 11 , 000 available for this research . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 .
