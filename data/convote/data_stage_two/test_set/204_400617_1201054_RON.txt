mr. speaker , just in response to what was said on the floor , this is a statement that has appeared on the floor , and also in print , which says that the bill before us prohibits federal funding used for the destruction of embryos . 
by its very definition , it requires the destruction of embryos when it does the research . 
that ought to be very clear . 
the process talked about requires the destruction of embryos .
