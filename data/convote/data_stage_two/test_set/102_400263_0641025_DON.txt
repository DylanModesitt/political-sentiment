mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
i want to make it clear , as there is a lot of misinformation being promoted on the other side here : our side supports relief for family farmers and small businesses . 
that is not what we are talking about here today . 
the difference between our approach is the three-tenths of 1 percent richest people in this country , the paris hiltons of the world , the executives at campbell soup , the heirs of campbell soup or mars candy if you read the washington post today . 
that is what this is about . 
in a climate where the majority is cutting medicaid , cutting veterans benefits , cutting programs that help feed the most vulnerable in our country , to go out and protect and to try to extend a special tax cut to those richest people in this country , i think , is unconscionable . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 .
