mr. chairman , i was listening to the gentleman framing the question , and the gentleman framed the question i think in the way that we should ask our colleagues for them to give us an answer .  i think what the gentleman has suggested in his very detailed and eloquent presentation , there is a judicial system in place that is functioning and functional .  we should take the boy scouts ' oath , make your camp better than you found it .  therefore , if there are issues that we can improve in the judiciary , let us do it .  but i am just looking at some information here that tells me that federal litigation is , in fact , decreasing .  a 2005 report issued by the u.s. department of justice says that the u.s. district courts in some areas , of course , fell 79 percent , fell 79 percent , the cases , the tort cases , between 1985 and 2003 .  according to the administrative office of the u.s. courts , tort actions in the u.s. district courts went down from 29 percent from 2002 to 2003 , so it fell 28 percent .  in addition , over the last 5 years , federal civil filings have not only decreased 8 percent , but the prefilings that are personal injury cases has also declined .  state litigation is decreasing .  the numbers show they are decreasing .  lawsuit filings are decreasing .  as i said , tort filings have declined 5 percent since 1993 .  contract filings have declined .  i do not particularly consider that a good omen .  i would like people to legitimately feel they can go into the courts for their remedies .  but the question is , it is not broken , and here we are putting heavier burdens on the court system that literally shuts the door closed to a number of individuals , and i think that is completely unacceptable for the responsibility of this congress .
