mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 420 , the lawsuit abuse reduction act .  the simple fact is , we have too many junk lawsuits being filed .  it is imperative we reform our tort system , and it seems to me this legislation is an important step in this direction .  the house has passed several common sense bills that will help make our court system less prone to abuse and more fair for victims , such as medical malpractice reform and class action reform .  today 's legislation would restore mandatory sanctions on lawyers and law firms filing frivolous lawsuits and eliminate the current safe harbor provision that allows lawyers to avoid sanctions by quickly withdrawing meritless claims .  the legislation also prevents forum shopping by requiring suits to be filed where a plaintiff resides , where an injury occurred , or where the defendant 's principal place of business is located .  tort reform will make american businesses more competitive and lower costs to consumers while ensuring true victims ' rights to sue for damages .  frivolous lawsuits have discouraged product development , stifled innovative research and cost millions in insurance and legal fees -- costs that often get passed on to consumers .  making the system less costly will increase job creation , benefiting businesses and consumers alike .  i support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do so as well .
