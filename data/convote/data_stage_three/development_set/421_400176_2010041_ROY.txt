madam speaker , i believe it is critical that we seek out abuses in existing agreements , and reform such laws that are detrimental to u.s. producers .  such is currently the case with unfair honey imports from china .  in my northern california congressional district , honey and honeybees play a critical role in pollinating many of our important export crops , including almonds .  because chinese `` new shippers '' are allowed to circumvent antidumping orders by posting bonds , the honey industry in california and nationwide faces serious and continuing price declines , making it difficult for honey producers to provide bees for pollination .  this bill would suspend the bonding privilege for a three-year period .  madam speaker , i would like to thank my colleagues , representative english , chairman shaw and chairman thomas for their work on this matter .
