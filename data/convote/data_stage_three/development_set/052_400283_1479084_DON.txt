mr. chairman , number one , when is the best time to eliminate a program other than before it gets fully established ?  so i think it is important to follow the committee 's recommendation .  the second thing is that we know that the police have asked for stables .  once they establish stables , the costs goes up ; the program is more established .  we have got more investment .  now is the time to kill it .  consolidate it with the park police .  i fully agree with the committee 's recommendation .
