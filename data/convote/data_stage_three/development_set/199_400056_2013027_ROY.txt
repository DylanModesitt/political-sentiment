mr. speaker , i would say everyone wants the modeling to be correct and for us to reestablish trust and confidence on our predictability of a budget number .  when we do that , we bring purity to the process and omb also brings trust and confidence .  i think there is lack of trust and confidence under the budget number , and omb has proven they are not as good of a caretaker here as they think they are .  we will work cooperatively with omb because they also are part of this process of the pain .
