madam speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds .  first of all , the last speaker appears to have read the other party 's bill , not ours .  the democrats ' bill is actually weaker than our bill because it ignores a recommendation by the gao to authorize the commerce department to use third-country information in countervailing duty cases against china consistent with china 's wto accession commitment .  without this provision , the countervailing duty provision would be difficult to use and could be subject to endless court challenges .  they have simply misread this legislation and done it in an egregious way .
