mr. chairman , i rise to make two fundamental points before we proceed to vote on this .  the two points are these : this resolution does not solve the real problem and it may create more problems than it purports to solve , and we have to understand that .  it does not solve the problem for this reason : by leaving us without a congress for 45 days , we essentially impose the opportunity for the executive branch to exert marshal law , and that is not what the framers of this country had in mind .  this bill , if we do not provide some mechanism for prompt replacement other than this bill , will leave this country governed by an unelected executive , a cabinet member most likely who not a single american elected to that office .  furthermore , it has a host of problems .  it does not address the possibility that one delegation will elect its representatives more promptly than another .  they will come to this body , choose one of its members as speaker .  that person could move on to become the president .  then another delegation comes in , et cetera .  you are essentially leaving this country without a house of representatives , without checks and balances , without separation of powers , for at least 45 days , assuming an election can be held in 45 days and assuming that the terrorists through an anthrax attack , like they subjected this very capitol to , will not somehow undermine that ability .  this is reality .  we have seen the reality here .  we saw those airplanes hit the buildings , we saw the anthrax , and yet we are not truly acting to solve this .
