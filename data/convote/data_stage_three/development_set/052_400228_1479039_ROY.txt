mr. chairman , i will address it in this way : i was here on 9/11 , as the gentleman was .  there is absolutely nothing for the members of congress to do .  that is the answer to the gentleman 's question .  the whole thing was taken over by the administration .  there is not going to be anything for any member of congress , any major decisions to be made during that period of time .  we do not need to be around here .
