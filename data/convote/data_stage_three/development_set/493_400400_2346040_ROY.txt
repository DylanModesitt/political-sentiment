mr. chairman , i rise in support of this bill .  what we have to remember is this is about the children , children whose families are trapped in poverty trying to get a head start on education , which is the surest way out of poverty .  it is disappointing to me there are some in here , because we provide some level of flexibility , and perhaps in some community it is a faith-based operation that can deliver the services best to a poor child in need of these services , that there are some willing to kill head start because of that level of flexibility .  in my hometown , thankfully , it is the public school systems that have taken over the head start program because we suffered through the difficulties of financial problems .  the previous head start organization managed the program so poorly that they could not pay the teachers and continue head start .  it had to be taken over by the federal government through an entity .  fortunately , omaha public schools have taken over head start in omaha , nebraska , providing over a thousand children an opportunity to have a coordinated head start educational program , a better education program , with assurances to the parents that it is going to be there next year .  in fact , they have even got a very progressive system for head start children based on educare , an outstanding private preschool program that involves a holistic approach of the entire family .  i want to end by thanking the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner )  because he also recognizes there was a glitch , a glitch that eliminated some of the lower-level rank-and-file service men and women from having their children in head start programs because of privatization of military housing .  the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner )  recognized that problem , corrected that problem , and i want to thank him for standing up for our service men and women with children that would be eligible for head start .
