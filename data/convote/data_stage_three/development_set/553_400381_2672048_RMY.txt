mr. speaker , i oppose this completely irrelevant motion to recommit .  first , nothing in h.r. 420 , the lawsuit abuse reduction act , prohibits anyone from being sued for fraud to the full extent of federal law .  second , the motion to recommit relates to contract claims when the section of the bill that it modifies relates only to personal injury claims .  there is no flaw in the bill that needs to be corrected , but even if there were , the motion to recommit fails to correct it because it relates to contract claims rather than personal injury claims .  mr. speaker , i just received a statement of administration policy from the executive office of the president which i would like to read , because it provides a good summary of h.r. 420 , the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 .  this statement reads as follows : `` the administration supports house passage of h.r. 420 in order to address the growing problem of frivolous litigation .  h.r. 420 would rein in the negative impact of frivolous lawsuits on the nation 's economy by establishing a strong disincentive to file such suits in federal and state courts .  junk lawsuits are expensive to fight and often force innocent small businesses to pay exorbitant costs to make these claims go away .  these costs hurt the economy , clog our courts , and are burdening the american businesses of america .  the administration believes the bill is a step in the right direction toward the goal of ending lawsuit abuse. '' mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to oppose this absolutely irrelevant motion to recommit and support the underlying bill .
