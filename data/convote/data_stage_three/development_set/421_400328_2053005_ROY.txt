mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  one of the items that the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern )  mentioned that i agree wholeheartedly with is the rise of china is one of the most significant developments of the 21st century , and that is why it is so critically important that we make sure that the trade agreements that exist between our country and theirs are enforced and are monitored .  that is what this bill does .
