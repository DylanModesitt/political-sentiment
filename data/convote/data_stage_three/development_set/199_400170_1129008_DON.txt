mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , i am a bit confuzzled by the continuing argument of my colleague and friend on the committee on rules that his state is impacted by virtue of education formulas .  i do not disagree with what the gentleman says , but i find it interesting that the state of utah , while the gentleman from utah ( mr. bishop )  is arguing that they are not getting enough money for education , the state of utah legislature passed measures saying they do not want any federal money for education .  they need to make up their mind so we know what all they are doing out there .
