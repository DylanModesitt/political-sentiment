mr. speaker , if the gentlemen from texas ( mr. delay )  does not object , let me yield to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank )  , the ranking member , because i know he has worked very hard with the gentleman from ohio ( mr. oxley )  , as you well know , in a very bipartisan way .  you mentioned 63 to 5 , 65 to 5 ; and so we did not perceive there to be much opposition to the bill .
