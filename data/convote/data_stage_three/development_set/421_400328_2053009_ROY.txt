mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , let me just take one moment to correct something that was said by my friend from massachusetts about this week being filled with renaming of post offices .  we have also managed to find time this week to pass the first comprehensive postal reform in years .  there is the strong likelihood of at least a couple of appropriations conference reports ; the central american free trade agreement ; a highway conference report ; an energy conference report ; and a bill to get strict with china about enforcing our trade agreements .  the gentlewoman from new york is correct .  this bill was up for a vote yesterday on the suspension calendar .  under house rules it requires a two-thirds vote to be passed .  it garnered 240 votes , shy of two-thirds , but a clear majority , with 19 democrats also believing that it was important to enforce trade agreements with china .  it was our mistake , apparently , to believe that there would be even broader bipartisan support , to believe that there would be more than 19 democrats who would want to enforce our trade agreements with china .  so it is back today where it requires a majority vote to pass .
