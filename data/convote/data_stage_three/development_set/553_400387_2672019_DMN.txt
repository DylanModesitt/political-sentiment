mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the so-called lawsuit abuse reduction act because it would hurt all americans by exposing them and their attorneys to motions intended to harass them and slow down the legal process , a tactic often used by wealthy defendants in civil rights trials .  prior to 1993 , defendants in civil rights cases would file a crushing number of motions alleging frivolous actions on the part of the plaintiff in a blatant attempt to delay the case .  in 1993 , the rules were changed and judges were empowered to determine sanctions for frivolous lawsuits on a case-by-case basis , removing this delay tactic from wealthy defendants .  however , since the republican party does n't think judges have any business deciding how to run their courts , they want to repeal this change and revert back to the days of delayed justice .  this is one of many reasons why the u.s. judicial conference , headed by chief justice john roberts , opposes this bill .  further , h.r. 420 is unconstitutional because it forces every state court to implement new court rules and procedures , even though congress has no jurisdiction over state courts .  justice delayed is justice denied and i am proud to stand up for our constitution , judicial system , and all americans by voting no on this bill .  if that makes me a friend of the trial lawyers , then i proudly stand with the brilliant litigators thurgood marshall and abraham lincoln in opposition to political hacks like karl rove and george w. bush .
