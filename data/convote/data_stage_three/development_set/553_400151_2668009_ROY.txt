madam speaker , i might point out that the people that oppose this legislation , as the gentleman from massachusetts mentioned earlier , are the very ones that support his party .  so i think that there is a little balance there , if that be true in either instance .  madam speaker , i would first like to close this debate by thanking my colleagues for a very productive discussion of both the rule and h.r. 420 .  the opportunity before this house today is another example of how this congress has improved our legal system and preventing frivolous lawsuits from closing the doors of justice for those who have truly been harmed .  contrary to what the opponents of legal reform might say , the underlying bill , as well as other recent bills , do not demonstrate contempt for our legal system or the esteemed profession of attorneys , but rather demonstrate respect for the important and historic role of our judicial system in defending the rights and ensuring the constitutional application of the laws .  frivolous lawsuits have not only driven up costs and destroyed economic opportunity for the american people , but they have also damaged the image of the courts .  when the american people stop respecting the decisions of the judiciary , the courts begin to lose their effectiveness , and they cease to perform their constitutionally mandated role .  for the sake of the courts and for the sake of the american people , we in this house need to push forward with this additional meaningful and genuine reform .  therefore , i would like to urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the center aisle to support this rule and the underlying bill .
