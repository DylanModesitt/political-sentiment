mr. speaker , reclaiming my time .  i appreciate the majority leader 's response .  there obviously is a difference of view of how soon that those dollars could flow from the ranking member of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the full committee .  you mentioned days .  i would certainly hope it could be days .  because i think we would all be advantaged in a bill , particularly if we could pass it with the overwhelming majority that was received both in the subcommittee and in the full committee .  moving on , mr. leader , in addition to the bills you have listed for next week , do you anticipate any hurricane katrina-related legislation will come to floor ?  and if so , will those bills go through the committee of jurisdiction and be considered under rules on the floor that allow full debate ?  you mentioned , as a preface to that , obviously almost all of us voted for the $ 52 billion .  but i think everybody on the floor was concerned about the level of information we had about what had been spent of the $ 10 billion , how much was going to be spent , on what , of the $ 52 billion .  in that context i ask that question .
