mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , the gentleman , again , is trying to inflame what i think is really an unreasonable discussion in this conversation .  the point of faith-based providers is that they are mostly obviously church people who have a mission .  they want to provide a service .  they are not discriminating against others .  they are encouraging service within their church , and we should allow them to provide that service because we know that they have the best track record of success .
