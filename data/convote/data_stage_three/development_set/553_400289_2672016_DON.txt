mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i thank the gentlewoman .  i think the gentlewoman has established not only that the system is not broken , but that any claim of an avalanche of frivolous litigation is absurd for these kinds of statistics of declining use of the courts , of declining caseloads , of declining filings .  again , the courts have not requested this , they have not said that there is any problem , there is any problem existing .  this is an attempt again to shut the courthouse doors to people who need access to the courts , and on the most fundamental grounds of justice , this bill ought to be soundly rejected .
