mr. speaker , i thank the majority leader for that information .  first of all , on the general proposition for the month of october , we had had discussions last week ; and it is clear that the second week of october , it will not be practical to meet because of the various important dates on that week .  the first week was somewhat in flux at that point in time .  could the majority leader bring us up to date on where currently the thinking of the leader 's office is on where we will be on the first week of october ?
