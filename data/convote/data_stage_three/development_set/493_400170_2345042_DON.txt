mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  when i was a child , my grandmomma took me to churches .  she played piano for all of the churches in town , four in altamonte springs .  sometimes i did not know whether i was going to be sprinkled and be baptized here or repent and be baptized .  it was very difficult , but all of the children in that town went to all of the churches .  for 41 years head start has existed , and it is the most empirically collected database organization supporting the children of the united states of america .  and for all of those 41 years , all of these faith-based organizations have been involved in receiving contracts to do business .  what we are saying is they can not do it with federal dollars .  they have to do it with their own money .
