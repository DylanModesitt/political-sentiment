mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 .  reform of the endangered species act is much needed .  the law has adversely affected thousands of farmers , ranchers and homeowners whose private property has been taken without compensation .  over 90 percent of endangered plant and animal species are found on private property .  there should be a balance between the rights of property owners and conservation .  h.r. 3824 will allow the secretary of interior to compensate private property owners for the fair market value of the loss of use of their property when the secretary concludes that the use of the property would be a taking .  the compensation will be made available as aid and through a grant program .  this is a fair and long-overdue process that will actually promote preservation and conservation of endangered species and at the same time protect private property rights .
