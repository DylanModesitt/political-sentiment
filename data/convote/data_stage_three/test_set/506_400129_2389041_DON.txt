mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise as a member probably more affected by this law than anybody else in the united states congress .  i probably represent more critical habitat in the coastal counties of monterey bay than anybody .  that is the big sur , carmel , pebble beach , santa cruz region .  that critical habitat has made us a lot of money on what is watchable wildlife .  watchable wildlife is the largest business , fastest-growing business in the united states .  of all the sports in this country , watchable wildlife exceeds them all .  this bill undermines the greatest economic asset we have , which is our natural things by creating a new issue on takings .  you argue the bill is broken because the administration has not been able to administer it .  well , it is not the bill that is at fault ; it is the united states congress and the president of the united states that are at fault .  i am on the committee on appropriations , and in 2003 the fish and wildlife service said it needed approximately $ 153 million to address the critical backlog of listings of critical habitat ; yet the president only asked for $ 18 million .  this is the way to kill an organization .  you do not fund it , and say , look , the law does not work , you have a backlog .  so let us take the law .  every city councilmember , every city supervisor in the united states ought to wake up and look at this law because now they give full development rights under this law .  if you do not like the way the law is , you have trees in your backyard that the government says , the community says you ought to preserve , you do not have to worry about that now because you can say that is a taking .  pebble beach , cut all of your cypress trees and pine trees , which are the monterey cypress and the monterey pines , because now instead of beautiful scenery , you can build hotels all over that land .  and if they do not allow you to do that because of the trees , the government will pay you .  mr. speaker , guess what , the government has no money .  it can not even pay the bureaucrats that are responsible for carrying out the law .  this bill is a gun to the head .  this bill says if you do not grant that development , by god , government , you have to pay it .  the lawyers say , government , you have no money , you better grant the request .  this is a full development rights .  it is an attack on america 's greatest heritage .  it endangers wild and scenic species .
