mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for yielding me this time .  mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 .  science has advanced rapidly since the president announced his stem cell research policy .  these cells were just identified less than 10 years ago and , already , the technology is progressing by leaps and bounds .  the 22 lines currently available under the president 's policy were developed using outdated techniques and have been contaminated , possibly skewing the outcome of experiments .  given the promise that stem cells hold , it is time to drop the limit on current stem cell lines and allow researchers to do what they do best .  it is tragic to let these cells go to waste when they could help to relieve so much suffering .  it is time to let researchers go where the science leads them , not where politicians dictate .  in order to explore all of the possibilities , scientists must have access to all three kinds of stem cells : adult , embryonic , and those from the umbilical cord blood .  that is why i plan to vote for h.r. 810 and the smith bill as well .  the two are not in opposition ; they are complementary .  mr. speaker , i am proud to support h.r. 810 and for the sake of the millions suffering from diseases , i ask my colleagues to do the same .
