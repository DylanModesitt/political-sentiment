mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from texas for raising this issue .  data on young adults participating in adult education programs is important information for our committee as well as for the adult education programs and for school districts to keep in mind as we work to raise our high school completion rates .  and it is my understanding that this is information that the department already collects but has not been a focus in program reporting .
