mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i recall that democrats , when they were in charge , had a slightly different perspective , believing we were a co-equal branch of the government .  we would adopt our policies based upon what we believed to be in the best interests of this country , and that the president , as a co-equal branch of the government , would make his determination , and if we disagreed we would override his veto .  as a matter of fact , i voted to override a number of vetoes that the previous democratic president disagreed with us on .  the gentleman is right .  we do not seem to do that .  we have a 4 1/2 -year unblemished record , as the leader points out , of not doing anything that this president did not want us to do .
