mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 2520 , which establishes a national cord blood stem cell inventory , a cord blood system , and to reauthorize the national bone marrow registry .  this is an important piece of legislation because it addresses a vital need to establish a publicly coordinated national umbilical cord blood bank similar to the national bone marrow registry .  however , it is important to note that umbilical cord blood cells are a type of adult stem cells that have been used only to treat blood disorders like leukemia and lymphoma .  scientists do not believe that these cord blood stem cells will provide answers to diseases like diabetes , parkinson 's , spinal cord injuries , or other nonblood-related disorders .  according to dr .  david shaywitz , an endocrinologist and stem cell researcher at harvard , it seems extremely unlikely that adult blood cells or blood cells from the umbilical cord will be therapeutically useful as a source of anything else but blood .  that is why we must support all forms of stem cell research , including embryonic stem cell research , so researchers have the greatest chance of discovering treatments and cures .  that is why i am supporting this legislation as well as h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act , to expand the current federal embryonic stem cell policy .  i urge everyone to support this legislation and support h.r. 810 .
