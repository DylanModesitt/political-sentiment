mr. speaker , a family invests their embryos .  they are not going to save them for 1 , 000 years .  some of those embryos cryogenically deteriorate so they are going to discard those embryos .  others are just thrown down the toilet because someone does not want them anymore .  those are the embryos that we can use for stem cell research , only the ones that are going to be thrown away .  if there are 400 , 000 , then we will use 400 , 000 .  if there are only 10 , we will use 10 unless they can be adopted , which i also support in this bill .  people say that there has been no research .  if you take a look in animals , they have actually saved spinal cords in animals , in heart , in alzheimer 's , but they just have not done it in humans .  there is potential , both for adult and embryonic stem cell .  i have been here 15 years and i am 100 percent prolife , 100 percent .  this is an issue of life to me .  i had a 6-year-old in the committee that said , duke , you 're the only person who can save my life .  do you have a child with diabetes ?  do you have a child with other diseases that could be prevented ?  then you would support this .  i am for life and i am for the quality of life , but i do not want another 6-year-old to die .  i opposed the california bill .  it went too far .  i do not support cloning , but i want to save life .  we are this close to stopping juvenile diabetes .  there are other embryos that are tainted so bad that you would not implant those and they want to study those so that they can stop those childhood diseases .  but you can not look a child in the eye when the only chance they have to live is this research .
