reclaiming my time , mr. speaker , and i respect the opinion of my good friend from florida , but i think there was oversight .  but i would actually agree with his fundamental point in the sense that i think oversight is more effectively done by the elected representatives of the people , by the appropriate people who are responsible for implementing the solution .  i do not think we should take that model and follow it again here .  i also would suspect that the situation between a deliberate attack on the united states and a natural disaster are very different .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
