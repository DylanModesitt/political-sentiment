mr. chairman , the policies congress has implemented over the last four years have provided a solid foundation for american workers and businesses to build a strong economy .  with steady job growth over the last 20 months putting over 2.7 million americans back to work , it is clear that congress has the right priorities : working americans and their families .  american workers need access to job-training in order that they may obtain the skills to perform the jobs of the 21st century .  americans want more than a job -- they want jobs with higher pay and that provide them with meaning and personal satisfaction .  they also want a career , a future , and financial independence in retirement .  as our economy shifts from production to service related jobs , and from low-tech to high-tech occupations , americans need access to education and job training that provides them with the skills they need to perform .  mr. chairman , when enacted , this plan will pair workers with the employers who need the skills they offer , and vice versa .  in a dynamic and changing world economy , many americans are faced with the reality that they might have to change careers multiple times .  this plan will strengthen the ties between job training programs , adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs and the people they serve so they can continue to grow in their careers .  of particular importance to me and my colleagues who support this plan is provision i proposed that is reflected in the bill we 're voting on today .  the provision paves the way for added support for disabled veterans who need help finding meaningful work as they transition to the civilian sector after their dedicated service to our nation .  the men and women of our armed forces who have given of themselves should not only be honored , but aided as much as possible in starting life again upon their return .  the job training improvement act is a crucial step in taking the american workforce into the 21st century , and i encourage my colleagues to support its passage .
