mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , i would like to remind the gentleman that in the original bill that we considered , h.r. 3199 , which 43 of his colleagues supported , there were sunset provisions not in two , but in three , sections that were of 10 years ' duration .  in their motion to instruct the conferees , the request was to abide by the senate bill , which would lower those to 4 years each .  so that is exactly what we are bringing back in the conference report , exactly what they asked for .
