mr. chairman , it is my understanding that the secretary currently has in place emergency regulations that allow for expedited consultation in the event of an immediate threat to public safety , as , for example , when the floodwaters are rising and are feet or perhaps even inches away from breaking or breaching a levee .  is the chairman 's understanding that the intent of the legislation is to require the development of additional regulations that would allow the secretary to expedite the application of the act for agency actions necessary to address threats to human health or safety ?
