mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute .  the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher )  is sincere in his opposition to this bill , and i respect that .  however , neither the national security letter scheme nor the delayed notification scheme were authorized for the first time by the patriot act .  that was legislation that was in place prior to october 2001 when the original patriot act was passed and signed into law by the president .  what the patriot act did in both national security letters as well as in delayed notification warrants was simply to extend to anti-terrorism investigations authorities that already existed and up until that time had been found constitutional in investigations such as mafia investigations , racketeering investigations , and drug-trafficking investigations .  so these complaints were not caused by the patriot act .  they were caused by existing legislation , and we should deal with that , not in the context of this bill but elsewhere .
