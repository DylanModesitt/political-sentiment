mr. speaker , the gentlewoman from tennessee ( mrs. blackburn )  is so eloquent in her words about freedom and the economy and what makes this country great .  we have the healthiest economy in the world , and i want to build on the things that my colleagues have said .  the reason we have the healthiest economy in the world is because we are the freest people in the world .  i agree with what the president has been saying .  if we want to see a good world , we want to see people have all of the rights and privileges , we are going to see freedom throughout the world and we are going to see growing economies .  as again the gentlewoman from tennessee ( mrs. blackburn )  said , job creation was up in 48 of the 50 states last year , and unemployment was down in all regions .  i want to talk a little bit about the job training improvement act which is going to be voted on here tomorrow .  the committee on education and the workforce has passed it out of our committee after a great deal of debate .  h.r. 27 is called strengthening america 's job training system .  it builds on the significant reforms made in the bipartisan workforce investment act improvements that were enacted in 1998 .  while those reforms have provided workers with resources and tools necessary to rejoin the workforce or retrain for better jobs , there were still areas of inefficiency and duplication that were remaining .  what h.r. 27 is going to do , among other things , is eliminate duplication and waste .  it consolidates three adult job training programs into one consolidated adult funding stream to streamline program administration and reduce inefficiency at the state and local level .  this change will enable more job seekers to be served with no reduction in services .  last week we talked a lot about inefficiency and waste , and this is another one of the ways that we are going to do that .  we are going to ensure our one-stop delivery system is demand driven .  we are going to remove barriers to job training .  the bill eliminates arbitrary provisions of current law that prevent someone from accessing training immediately if appropriate to meet his or her employment goals .  state and local areas will have the flexibility to tailor services to meet individual needs , and that is so important to us as we drive down the decisionmaking to the local level .  the bill is also going to protect the rights of faith-based groups to help train and retrain workers .  the bill protects the rights of faith-based groups willing to participate in the nation 's job training system .  the landmark 1964 civil rights act makes clear that faith-based groups have the right to hire workers on a religious basis , and that such hiring practices do not constitute discrimination .  former president clinton signed a number of major laws upholding this right .  we are going to strengthen partnerships between businesses and job-training service providers .  we are going to improve adult education and enhance vocational rehabilitation .  the bill includes a number of provisions designed to strengthen the 1973 rehabilitation act in a continuing effort to help individuals with disabilities become employable and achieve full integration .  i want to make a comment about a wonderfully significant thing that happened in the fifth congressional district last week related to increasing jobs , and that was that dell manufacturing broke ground for a $ 100 million plant in forsythe county .  that plant is dell 's largest anywhere , 527 , 000 square feet .  they are going to hire 700 people in the first year .  workers are going to assemble two of dell 's desktop models , the dimension and the optiplex , in the new plant .  the jobs there are going to pay an average of $ 27 , 000 .  we are about 2 weeks away from the start of a process where people can express interest in being hired for the first 200-250 jobs , then dell will hire another 500 people .  most of these will be people from the fifth congressional district .  we are so excited to have dell manufacturing in forsythe county .  again , i think this is an indication that the policies of this president and the policies of this congress are working in terms of reducing taxes and making our south a very good place to bring new jobs .
