mr. speaker , we have heard a lot of rhetoric here today , and some of it a bit disingenuous .  i think it is a bit disingenuous to say in a loud tone , demanding an answer to some rhetorical question , and then demand , well , i hear none , when all of us here are observing the rules and not interrupting .  it is a bit interesting to hear people talk about red herrings , and i like hearing from people across the aisle that they want to talk about real facts .  so let me talk about real facts .  this , my friends , is a music box .  it plays amazing grace .  i would wind it up and play it now if the rules allowed that .  it belonged to my great aunt lillie .  she was land rich .  over a hundred years their family accumulated land , farm and ranch .  i bought this music box at an irs auction where the irs forced the sale of everything she owned .  they accumulated about 2 , 500 acres of farm and ranch land .  she died in july of 1986 , and shortly thereafter land was dumped on the market .  times were rough , and the value of the land that was around $ 2 , 000 an acre when she died went to $ 600 or $ 700 an acre .  the irs was actually very gracious .  they gave a couple of extensions or so .  they allowed another appraisal , but it was around $ 2 , 000 an acre when she died .  the irs required the sale of every acre of land that they owned .  they sold every item out of her home .  if anybody in the family wanted anything , we had to show up at the auction and buy it .  i bought this keepsake to remember my great aunt lillie , who had been so gracious and kind and a great farm woman and a great gentlewoman .  so if you want to talk about the death tax in real facts , here it is .  the death tax provides no grace , amazing or otherwise .  it is a socialist notion , and it needs to go away .
