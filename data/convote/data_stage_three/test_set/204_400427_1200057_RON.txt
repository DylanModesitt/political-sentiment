mr. speaker , i rise again to set the record straight .  there have been some people who have implied there is limited capacity for these cord blood stems to be used successfully .  they have been shown to be pluripotent .  they can become all different cell types , and they have shown a tremendous amount of plasticity .  this poster is of a young lady who was paralyzed for years and had an adult stem cell transplant .  she is able to stand up .  but i just want to clarify on the cord blood , it has been used to treat leukemia , adrenoleukodystrophy , burkitt 's lymphoma , chronic granulomatous diseases , congenital neutropenia , digeorge 's syndrome , fanconi 's anemia , and these are just some of them , gaucher 's disease .  hodgkin 's disease , cord blood has been used successfully to treat hodgkin 's disease ; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , which is a really bad disease .  i used to see some of those .  krabbe 's disease i mentioned earlier , that was just in the new england journal this month .  lymphoma ; lymphoproliferative syndrome ; myelofibrosis ; neuroblastoma , which is a form of brain tumor which has been successfully treated with cord blood .  osteopetrosis has been successfully treated .  reticular dysgenesis , severe aplastic anemia .  the list goes on and on .  there are 65 different medical conditions that have been successfully treated with cord blood .  people have mentioned diabetes .  embryonic stem cells have not been successfully used to treat diabetes either , but actually in animal models adult stem cells have been used successfully to treat diabetes .  i think most of the hope and success is in this cord blood .  that is why this bill is very , very important .
