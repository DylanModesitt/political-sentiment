madam speaker , i thank the chairman for his cosponsorship and his leadership in making sure that this meth bill can pass this bill in the form of passing a conference report , which is the only real way to get this done .  i also want to say briefly that i support section 215 , which amends the import and export act to make sure that we can have better prosecution methods .  eighteen of the 40 major organizations that are involved in terrorism also deal in narcotics .  the methamphetamine act is the single , first comprehensive anti-meth bill that we have ever introduced in congress , let alone passed in congress .  it is a sweeping anti-meth bill .  it will require all pseudoephedrine and ephedrine products to be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet ; impose a daily and monthly purchase limit ; require purchasers to show id and sign a logbook ; and require training of all employees handling the product .  it closes a number of loopholes in existing import , export , and wholesale regulations of meth precursor chemicals , including import and manufacturing quotas to ensure no oversupply leads to diversion ; and regulation of the wholesale `` spot market. '' it requires reporting of major meth precursor exporters and importers .  it would hold them accountable for their efforts to prevent diversion to meth production .  it toughens federal penalties against meth traffickers and smugglers .  it authorizes the meth hot spots program as well as increases funding for drug courts , drug endangered children programs , and programs to assist pregnant women addicted to meth .  in addition , it has epa environmental regulations .  i want to thank democrats and republicans for all their bipartisan effort .  this is something we did in a bipartisan way .  this is our best chance to really get ahead of this epidemic that swept from asia to hawaii to california , the northwest to the plains , to the great lake states , is headed into the east and is into north carolina , south carolina , pennsylvania , and new york and headed to the atlantic ocean .  this is our attempt , a massive coordinated multicommittee that took many chairmen to do this , senators talent and feinstein of the senate to do this .  i thank chairman sensenbrenner , i thank the leadership , because this is a big day for those of us who have been fighting the anti-meth cause .
