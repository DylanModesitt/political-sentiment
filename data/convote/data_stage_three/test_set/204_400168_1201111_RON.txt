mr. speaker , i thank the majority leader for yielding me this time , and i am rising in opposition to the legislation that would fund the destruction of embryos in order to take the stem cells for research .  there are a number of reasons that i oppose the bill .  the very first one , though , is one of the statements we keep hearing over and over again from those who support the bill , and that is that these embryos would just be discarded .  this morning , i met several families , parents with young children who are here in washington .  these children were just like every other child , but they were different .  and they were different because these children are the snowflake babies .  they have been referred to a little bit today , but for those just joining the argument , the snowflake babies are born from what would have been discarded embryos in fertilization clinics .  it is important that we know this , because it is not , no option , that these embryos would be discarded or tossed aside .  it is true these embryos are often adopted .  and , in fact , the children i met today were wonderful evidence of that .  it looks like these embryos do not have to be discarded .  all they needed was a mother and 9 months .  we do not have to choose between embryonic stem cell research and cord blood , assuming that only embryonic can solve problems .  and , in fact , there is no proof that embryonic stem cell research can be successful .  this list on the left on this chart shows all the different treatments currently using adult stem cells .  on the right is the list of success with embryonic stem cells .  it is a pretty empty list .  i encourage my colleagues to reject the false promise of embryonic stem cell research and reject this legislation .
