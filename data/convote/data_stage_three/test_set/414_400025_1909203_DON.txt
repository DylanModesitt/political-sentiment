i think underlying the gentleman from michigan 's question , is this not about the difference between the fbi and law enforcement using a national security letter to ask a bank to give it the financial records of all of its customers versus asking the bank to give it the financial records of the specific individuals it suspects might be involved or that it is interested in ?  i think that is at the heart of the question of the standard .  that is why relevance to a terrorist investigation is not an adequate standard .  you want the focus on something specific , rather than all of the bank 's records of everybody who uses that bank .  you want the people who might have had contact with the terrorist or suspected terrorist .
