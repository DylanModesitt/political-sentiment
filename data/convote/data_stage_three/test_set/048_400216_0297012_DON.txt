mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  in summary , i urge a no vote on this bill .  in 1998 , the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon )  who is a very good friend of mine , we will always remain friends , we have great respect for one another , we wrote a very good bill in 1998 , wia , and i hope we would do likewise this time ; but i find myself unable to support this bill .  the bill , among other things , i do not mean to be harsh , but among other things , encapsulates president bush 's response to the woman in omaha who told him that she was presently working three jobs to ensure that she could provide for her family .  and the president responded , `` uniquely american , is n't it ?  i mean , that is fantastic that you 're doing that. '' mr. chairman , we can do better than that .
