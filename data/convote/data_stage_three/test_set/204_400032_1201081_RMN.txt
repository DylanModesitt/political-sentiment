mr. speaker , i want to thank our chairman , and also thank the leader .  you know , i believe that everybody engaged in this debate today means well , and this is one of those great debates that we have on this floor .  it is full of passion .  but this is not a debate about passion .  it is not a debate about style .  this is a debate about substance .  and the substance of this debate is life , clear and simple .  you know , there is a fact on this , also , i think we ought to look at .  while we do not know where embryonic stem cell research might lead us , we do know that engaging in this form of research would require ending a human life for the purpose of experimentation .  and that is something that i do not think any of us want to sanction .  and in my opinion , we would be giving away our humanity , our sense of ethics , for the mere hope , the mere hope that this form of research would someday yield results .  meanwhile , h.r. 810 , the bill that is under discussion diverts funds from research that has proven results , from research that does not require us to look the other way while human life is purposely ended .  adult stem cell research has made great leaps .  we have heard about that today .  cord blood research has made great strides .  we have heard about that also today .  and we hear that by using islet cells from living donors or adult brain cells instead of embryos , there is a potential to cure diabetes .  i think we should all vote `` no '' on h.r. 810 .  we should stop and look at the substance of the debate .
