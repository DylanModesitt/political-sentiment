mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , i just have to respond to the comments by the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette )  .  she must be reading a different bill .  that is what this whole argument is about .  the gentlewoman says that no federal funds can go to destroying an embryo in order to have research .  she just said that .  that is what this whole bill does is to allow funding of embryonic stem cell research , and in order to do that research , you have to destroy the embryo .  in fact , if the gentlewoman would like , i would be willing to entertain a unanimous consent request that if , indeed , that does not happen in her bill , i will be glad to accept it and i will vote for the bill .  that is the whole notion of what is going on here .  it is not true to say that her bill does not allow federal funding for destruction of embryos .
