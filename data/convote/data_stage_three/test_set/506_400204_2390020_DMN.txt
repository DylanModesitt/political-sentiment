mr. chairman , i rise today to request that my name be removed as a cosponsor of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 ( tesra ) .  species conservation is an essential tenet in the effort to promote and maintain a healthy environment .  although i agree with congressman pombo 's initiative in principle , after reviewing the legislation closely i came to the conclusion that this bill would jeopardize critical habitat protections that endangered plants and animals need to survive and recover their populations , and it would do little to protect the planet 's most threatened wildlife .  as a senior member of the house science committee , i also have serious reservations that in its current form , h.r. 3824 attempts to substitute politics for sound science in decisions involving endangered species , letting expediency and profit motives influence what should be scientific decisions .
