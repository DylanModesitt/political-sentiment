mr. speaker , the president and his administration continue its rhetoric that anyone calling for a withdrawal of troops or questioning the intelligence that led us into the iraq war is unpatriotic , while , on the other hand , using this war as an excuse , a patriot act was passed that recklessly violates our civil liberties and attacks the very freedoms our troops in iraq are told that they are fighting to protect .  this administration and the leadership in this very house we are standing in has tried every trick in the book to spread the blame , pass the buck on this misguided war .  they continue to filter the debate in our very own country and to discredit those who disagree with them .  this bill they want us to pass today would continue to limit our constitutional freedoms in our very own country .  though they did not seem to care one bit about the facts before 9/11 , they now believe the united states will benefit from hoarding insignificant and ill-gotten information on innocent americans .  they believe that this makes us a safer nation .  if you want to talk about dishonesty , look at this administration 's policies that have led us to ignore facts in order to manipulate the very policies that fly in the face of our own honesty , and this is an administration that also pays for `` canned '' news overseas .  the real patriots have been those who stand up and question the misleading intelligence and dishonest tactics that got us into this war , those who have challenged the patriot act and its impact on the civil rights and civil liberties of every american .  actually , it is patriotic to question how the patriot act affects the very rights that we live under in this country of ours .  vote `` no '' on this patriot act .
