mr. speaker , i support h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 .  h.r. 810 is the safest , most ethically and morally sound way to proceed with this potentially life-saving scientific advancement .  this debate is not about whether or not embryonic stem cell research should occur .  the administration is not stopping private embryonic stem cell research .  it just opposes the expansion of public stem cell research .  the private sector is not restricted from such research .  the private sector currently uses frozen embryos which would otherwise be discarded .  corporate entities already have access to 125 new and better embryonic stem cell lines , created after august 9 , 2001 , when the president announced his new stem cell policy .  h.r. 810 expands the number of frozen embryos to be used for stem cell research by the federal government .  federally sponsored research is subject to greater oversight and safeguards and higher ethical standards .  ethical controls over privately funded research are limited .  recent scientific breakthroughs have demonstrated that embryonic stem cell research has life saving potential .  it could result in saving millions of lives .  it could be the answer to the prayers of those who suffer from parkinson 's , diabetes , cancer , heart disease , spinal cord injuries and other debilitating conditions .  recent studies have set back the case for the efficacy of adult stem cells .  embryonic stem cell research will continue with or without the federal government .  this bill expands federal research , which will be subject to greater oversight and safeguards .
