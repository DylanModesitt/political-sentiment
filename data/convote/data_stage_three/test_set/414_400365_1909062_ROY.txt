mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 1/2 minutes .  mr. chairman , we have heard another attack on delayed notification or sneak-and-peek warrants .  let me tell you what has happened earlier this month .  a u.s. district judge in washington state executed or authorized a delayed-notification warrant to look into a building on the u.s. side of the northern border .  and what was discovered but a rather sophisticated tunnel between canada and the united states to smuggle contraband , and perhaps terrorists , through the border and into this country without being detected by our border patrol .  using a delayed-notice search warrant , the dea and other agents entered the home on july 2 to examine the tunnel .  shortly thereafter , a u.s. district judge authorized the installation of cameras and listening devices in the home to monitor the activities in the home .  using these twice , federal , state and local law enforcement officials observed multiple trips by three defendants through the tunnel carrying large hockey bags or garbage bags .  these bags were loaded into a van on the u.s. side and driven south for delivery .  ninety-three pounds of marijuana were found in these bags when the washington state patrol stopped the car .  that never would have happened without a delayed-notification warrant .  and if they can bring 93 pounds of marijuana in , they can bring terrorists in as well .  these warrants are good .  they protect us .  they ought to be kept .
