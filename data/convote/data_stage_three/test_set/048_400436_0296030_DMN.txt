mr. chairman , once again my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are claiming they want to help workers in this nation .  but , as usual , their actions say otherwise .  the newest wia proposal does nothing more than force workers to compete with each other for services that they have come to expect and services they deserve from the wia system .  wia one-stops provide important job training services to help those struggling to find work to get resources they need .  if this bill passes , veterans and unemployed adults will be placed second to infrastructure costs .  instead of increasing funding in the bill to address infrastructure needs separately , this bill forces governors to choose between workers and updating facilities , all from the same pot of money .  limiting this pool of funding will deny workers quality services for reemployment and adult education programs , and that is just plain and simple true .  this bill also sets up a voucher system that will actually decrease the amount of services available to job seekers .  those receiving these new job vouchers will be able to pay for training courses or other job-searching expenses .  that sounds great .  but the catch is that once a worker takes a voucher , they will lose access to federal job training programs through wia for an entire year .  money and services are both critical for many workers to get back on track , particularly when they have become unemployed over and over again , and workers who should not have to make the choice between one or the other are continually faced with the dilemma .  this bill also changes the way in which the government will evaluate the success of wia programs .  now workers will be judged on how they serve the company they work for rather than on the quality of services they received under wia .  since when was wia focused on big business ' needs rather than the worker 's needs ?  the worst part of this bill , however , is that it will write discrimination into the law .  at religious institutions receiving wia funds , those who share the same religious philosophies will have an advantage over those applying for employment that do not subscribe to the same views .  workers can now lose job opportunities through blatant religious discrimination at places our tax dollars are funding .  this bill turns wia into a competitive service provider , rather than an equal opportunity resource for our nation 's unemployed workers .  this is not the way we can help our nation 's workforce , and i urge my colleagues to oppose h.r. 27 as it is written .
