mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , there has been a lot of rhetoric thus far on the rule , and i suspect there will be a lot of rhetoric when we debate the bill ; but there is one underlying thread here that needs to be mentioned .  it was mentioned by the gentleman from utah ( mr. bishop )  , the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza )  , and the gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest )  .  that is that the endangered species act needs to be updated .  i came here 10 years ago , and this is one of the big issues that was very important to my constituency when i first ran .  there was talk then about amending the endangered species act , but there was no agreement at all .  we did get a bill out of committee .  unfortunately , it did not go any further .  but now we hear today that there is 90 percent agreement on the need to change the endangered species act , but there is violent 10 percent disagreement on what those means should be .  i contend that is huge , huge movement from where we have gone in 10 years .  i do not know what the reasons are , but i expect the reasons are the inflammation of the existing act .  so with that , mr. speaker , i urge support of the rule .  mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution .  the previous question was ordered .
