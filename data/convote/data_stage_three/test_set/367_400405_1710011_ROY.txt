mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from louisiana for yielding me this time .  i welcome the comments from the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller )  .  he talks about a lot of issues that are more important to making america more competitive .  we may disagree on the track , but i think it is important that we do move forward with an r & amp ; d tax credit that is permanent .  i think it is important that we do move forward to protect intellectual property rights .  but he does make an additional point , and that it is always easy to be against something instead of for something .  if we are going to make progress , we need to work together ; so i would welcome him to join the economic competitive caucus because i think together we could find ways to fund technology grants and technology schools .  and i would like to point out that we have doubled the funding for the national science foundation , and we continue the strong funding of that .  the gentleman from new york ( mr. owens )  also mentioned a couple of things that i think are important to be addressed in this debate .  one is the effect that china is having on our economy , and i think the point was made by the gentleman from new york that regulation is not holding them back .  but let me tell the members what is happening in china .  they have focused on technology .  they graduated 350 , 000 engineers last year .  they graduated more english-speaking electrical engineers than america did , and they have done that because they want to target certain areas .  in kansas they have targeted several industries : the hand truck industry , the auto lift industry .  they are trying to run american businesses out of business so that they can have a corner on the market , and that is why we need to have enforceable trade policy , which is part of this resolution .  the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller )  addressed education .  that is why education and lifelong learning is part of this resolution .  but let me just tell the members what china is doing that i think is important to the debate and why i think they should understand why we need to address these issues today instead of putting them off .  the regulation barriers that we have are keeping us from doing wonderful things that could help create and start jobs .  in china they are trying to create a silicon valley .  they have set up a top-notch university .  they have given venture capital to the area .  they have office space available .  they have property management for anybody who has a good idea .  they have legal advice , patent advice .  they even allow professors and students to start businesses on their own .  the way to address that is by changing our system and removing the barriers .  the gentleman from new york ( mr. owens ) mentions the trial lawyers , the $ 40 billion that came out of our economy for trial lawyers .  just think , if we apply some commonsense reforms , we can make jobs in america .  one example is in 1995 when the statute of repose was passed , which put commonsense limits on the manufacture of airplanes , and the following year 4 , 000 jobs were created in kansas alone , plus additional jobs all across the united states .  all we are saying in this resolution is let us step back from what we are doing today and say if we were going to start this system tomorrow , would we do the same thing ?  will it impact jobs ?  can we work together to create and keep jobs in america instead of seeing them slide off to other countries ?  so i think this is a good resolution , and i would welcome the suggestions from the other side , and i think together we can help bring jobs back to america .
