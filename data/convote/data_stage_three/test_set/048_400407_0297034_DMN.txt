mr. chairman , i thank the chairman very much .  this is an example of the collegiality of our committee on education and the workforce .  we do not agree often , but we at least have a good collegial time doing it .  i just want to stress the points that i made .  and the fact of the matter is that having a mandate that every state put all their money toward out-of-school youth does not help those states that have an in-school youth issue .  it also deprives a lot of programs that are working with our business community and in-school youth to get them better equipped to not only support themselves but their families to have them be more self-sufficient when they get out of school .  those programs would be slashed in many states if h.r. 27 were to go through as it is .  we have a great need for these in many states ; programs like girls inc. , action inc .  and others work that way .  i respect the chairman giving me this time to make that point , that this h.r. 27 change is a solution that does not have a problem .
