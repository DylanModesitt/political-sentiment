mr. speaker , the seminal question that we address is , should americans be using their tax dollars to fund research that kills a living human embryo ?  my answer to that is an emphatic `` no. '' it is our duty to ensure that we spend our money on things that work , and there are no therapies in humans that have ever successfully been carried out using embryonic stem cells .  and that is really what this whole debate is about , paying for what works and paying for it in a way that is consistent with the morals of our taxpayers .  look , even the president and ceo of the juvenile diabetes research foundation , a group that is a strong supporter of destroying human embryos for research , he said , `` there have been more promising results in adult stem cells than there have been in embryonic stem cells. '' he predicted that their foundation would soon be spending more on adult cells research than embryonic research .  private organizations like these are choosing to use their research dollars on what works , adult stem cells research .  washington must also spend its money efficiently on what works , while representing the values of the taxpayer .  i urge a `` no '' vote on federal funding for killing living human embryos .
