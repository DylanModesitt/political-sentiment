mr. speaker , in response to my good friend from california who said there must be sacrifices and sacrifices have been made , i would remind members of the words of benjamin franklin who once said that those who would give up their essential liberties to achieve a measure of security deserve neither .  the tragedy of 9/11 led to the patriot act , and then it led to a war against iraq .  fear and suspicion led the u.s. to roll back our civil liberties and attack a nation that did not attack us .  we have become a nation of leaders , some of whom who have condoned torture and illegal detentions .  fear and suspicion have driven us to that .  we need a different type of leadership so the american people could have been spared the effects of 9/11 .  it could have been different .  but , no .  we are here today trying to appeal to people to let go of their fear and suspicion because an open , honest review of the fbi 's use of the patriot act would surely find many areas in need of reform .  a careful balance between national security needs and protecting american rights must be struck , but that is not what we have here .  today we are set to pass a whole new round of democracy rollbacks .  american citizens are losing more of their free speech rights and privacy rights .  the authors of today 's bill inserted a very weak and loophole-ridden right to judicial review of government actions .  the american public is not served by such minimal accommodation .  today , the house will ignore more than 400 local communities and seven states that have passed resolutions asking for patriot act reform .  this legislation fails to provide reasonable sunset provisions that guarantee future congressional review .  the bill retains 4-year sunsets for only two of the 16 patriot act provisions and only one of two expiring provisions in the 2004 intelligence reform act .  all other intrusive powers are either made permanent or remain permanent .  this bill continues to allow roving wiretaps that permit federal agents to tap communications of a target where neither the target nor the phone is identified .  criminal wiretaps require one or the other , and the 10-day after-the-fact notice requirement is no substitute for privacy safeguards in the criminal wiretaps .  the bill continues to permit sneak-and-peak searches of a person 's home or business to remain secret indefinitely .  it drops a senate provision supported by the chamber of commerce , conservatives , libraries , civil liberties organizations that set limits on secret court orders for library , medical , and other personal records .  instead , the bill establishes a false right to judicial review .  a recipient must challenge before a preselected group of three court judges and go to the expense of hiring a lawyer with a security clearance who the fisa court agrees can appear before it .  so people have to essentially fight for their rights to be free of the scourge of wiretaps and to be free of the scourge of having the fbi reach into their library records , their reading records , their medical records .  where are we going with this country ?  it is not the america it used to be .  it has become something that is hard to recognize for many americans .  vote against this bill .
