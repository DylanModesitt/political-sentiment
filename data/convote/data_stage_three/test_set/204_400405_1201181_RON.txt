mr. speaker , 58 to zero .  today we are asked to sear our conscience and harden our heart towards human life so we can experiment on fertilized human embryos because we are told it holds such great promise .  the results from testing are far from promising , though .  they are very disappointing .  but there is an alternative .  the adult stem cell research has been very successful compared to embryonic stem cell research , and this success was accomplished without the destruction of human life .  in fact , more than 58 diseases have been treated using adult stem cells in contrast to no diseases having been treated by using living embryonic stem cell research .  fifty-eight to zero .  mr. speaker , how do we know the score ?  well , embryonic stem cell research is being conducted in america with private funding , but that funding is lacking .  so the labs have come to us for more money .  apparently , venture capitalists invest only in projects that are profitable , and you can see it is far from profitable here : 58 to zero .  so now we are asked to support embryo stem cell research because it is so promising , when the facts are it is not promising : 58 to zero .
