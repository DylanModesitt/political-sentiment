mr. speaker , in pertinent part , section 202 of s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 , '' amends section 524 of the bankruptcy code by making the discharge injunction inapplicable to certain acts by a creditor having a claim secured by a lien on real property that is the debtor 's principal residence , so long as the creditor satisfies certain criteria .  first , the creditor 's act must be in the ordinary course of business between the creditor and debtor .  second , such act is limited to seeking periodic payments associated with a valid security interest in lieu of pursuit of in rem relief to enforce the lien .  section 202 was included because congress recognized that there are many consumer debtors who , despite filing bankruptcy , desire to repay secured obligations in order to retain their principal residences .  under current law , however , some secured creditors stop sending monthly billing statements or payment coupons for fear of violating the discharge injunction .  section 202 is intended to reassure these secured creditors that if consumer debtors want to continue making voluntary payments so they can keep their principal residences , then secured creditors may take appropriate steps to facilitate such payment arrangements , such as continuing to send monthly billing statements or payment coupons .  moreover , despite the express reference in this provision to liens on real property , section 202 should not , by negative inference or implication , be construed as limiting any rights that may have developed through existing case law , or otherwise , that permit secured creditors to send , or consumer debtors to request and receive , monthly billing statements or payment coupons for claims secured by real or personal property .  see , e.g. , ramirez v. gmac ( in re ramirez ) , 280 b.r. 253 ( c.d .  cal .  2002 ) ; henry v. associates home equity services , inc ( in re henry ) , 266 b.r. 457 ( bankr .  c.d .  cal .  2002 ) .
