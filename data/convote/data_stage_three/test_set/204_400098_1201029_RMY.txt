mr. speaker , we need to remember that embryonic stem cell research is legal .  in the absence of the federal government , the states are already taking the lead .  california is at the forefront of establishing a robust embryonic stem cell research program .  new jersey has followed suit , and seven other states are in the process of doing so .  we do not want our stem cell research policies left to the vagaries of state electoral politics .  the federal government in general , and nih in particular , must be involved .  the less nih is involved with its time-tested methods and procedures , the less we are assured of good ethical guidelines and scientific methods will be followed .  instead , we will have more and more individual states attempting to set up their own regulatory schemes , something they may or may not be equipped to do .  opponents argue that it is the product of a utilitarian world view , that somehow this is a zero-sum game , if the members will , in which life is taken in order to give life .  i think the strictures that are established by h.r. 810 negate that argument .  under this bill , federal research will proceed using those embryos not used in fertility clinics , embryos voluntarily given that would otherwise be destroyed , that is , embryos that held the promise of life but are certain not to fulfill that promise .  what we are doing is extending the potential life where otherwise there would be none .  i urge passage of h.r. 810 .
