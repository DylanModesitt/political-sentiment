madam speaker , i will close for our side .  madam speaker , this bill overreaches .  it paves the way for abuse and is a potential threat to innocent , law-abiding citizens .  we are not a police state , and what makes us different from so many others is our freedom and our respect for basic civil liberties and our respect for privacy .  i understand the urge of some to embrace this legislation ; but let me remind you that every time you chip away at our civil liberties , you give the terrorists a victory .  you take away something that is essential to who we are as americans .  let us adjust and enhance our laws accordingly , to give law enforcement officials what they need ; but let us not give them more than what they need .  this bill puts us on a dangerous path .  there are over 150 provisions in this bill that are noncontroversial , that everybody agrees on , that will help track down terrorists and criminals ; but there are a few provisions that so cross the line that they threaten our privacy and our civil liberties and do not make us safer .  we can defend our country ; we can protect our people without trashing the constitution .  with that , madam speaker , i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on this bill .
