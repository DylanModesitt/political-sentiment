mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  i just want to say that when the gentleman talks about a taking , that is not what his legislation does .  all that has to happen is that a landowner proposes a use for his property , and if that use is ruled as a taking , the landowner gets compensated .  the landowner does not show that they could do that , that they could go through the city zoning , they could go through the county zoning , that they would get those permits to build those houses or whatever else he wants to do , or he could build that commercial establishment , no showing of that .  yet , under this legislation , he is entitled to compensation .  nothing has been taken , only the suggestion in the proposal on a plan .
