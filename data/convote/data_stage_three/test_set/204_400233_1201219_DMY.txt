mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act and h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act that we debated earlier today .  both bills would expand stem cell research , which holds tremendous promise to curing and treating some of the most devastating diseases and conditions facing americans today .  this issue is about medical research coupled with high ethical standards and providing hope to those most in need -- it should have no role in any party 's political agenda .  in 2001 , president bush announced that for the first time federal funds could be used to support limited research on human embryonic stem cells , specifically `` existing stem cell lines where the life and death decision has already been made. '' under this policy , only 78 embryonic stem cell lines are eligible for use and according to the national institutes of health ( nih ) , only 22 of those lines are viable for human research .  since 2001 , 128 embryonic stem cell lines have been developed that are ineligible for federally funded research .  both bills -- the stem cell therapeutic and research act that would create a new federal program to collect and store umbilical-cord-blood cells and expand the current bone-marrow registry program and the stem cell research enhancement act that would increase the number of stem cell lines that can be used in federally funded research -- establish much-needed ethical standards and expand the possibilities of stem cell research for new treatments and cures .  according to the nih , in the united states more than 4 million people suffer from alzheimer 's disease ; one in every four deaths is from cancer ; and every hour of every day , someone is diagnosed with juvenile ( type 1 ) diabetes .  these brave individuals battling life-threatening and debilitating diseases are not responsible for policy or debate , but they will be the ones most affected by the outcome of today 's vote .  the president was quoted by the associated press over the weekend saying , `` i made it very clear to the congress that the use of federal money , taxpayers ' money to promote science which destroys life in order to save life is -- i 'm against that .  and therefore , if the bill does that , i will veto it. '' this legislation will not create life for the purpose of destruction .  these bills will expand the scope of research that the bush administration has already approved .  it is unfortunate president bush would dash the hopes of so many people looking for medical answers through research .  mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues join me today in advancing science and supporting h.r. 810 .  congress and the administration must not withdraw from progress , but embrace the immense opportunities that expanded stem cell research can have for the future and wellbeing of our nation 's public health .
