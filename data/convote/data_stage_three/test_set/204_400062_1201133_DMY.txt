mr. speaker , as my colleague from massachusetts eloquently stated a minute ago , today this house has a historic opportunity to vote for hope , hope for millions of americans suffering with devastating diseases .  these patients , their doctors and scientists , have reason to hope , the potential that embryonic stem cell research has for developing new treatments for these devastating diseases .  one of my dearest friends recently died of als , or lou gehrig 's disease , which causes fatal destruction of nerve cells .  the slow death sentence that als gives its victims is brutal .  the disease took away my young friend tom 's ability to control his own muscles , paralyzing them and ultimately making it impossible for him to breathe .  stem cell research provides hope , not for tom but for future als victims .  scientists believe they can use stem cell research to replace the devastated nerve cells that als leaves behind .  with heart disease affecting so many of us in this nation , the promise of embryonic stem cell research has advancements for the human heart which are incredible to think of .  instead of patients suffering because their heart cells are failing and no longer able to pump blood , new ways could be discovered to replace those cells .  and with regard to cancer , stem cell research has enormous potential .  for example , it could facilitate the testing of new medications and treatments , not in time for my daughter 's life , but for her young children 's generation .  we can not afford to wait .  and it could be used to grow bone marrow that matches a patient and is not rejected by his or her body .  in each of these cases , stem cell research holds out promise .  it provides hope that longer , better-quality lives are possible .  that is what this bill is about .  it will expand the ability of the national institutes of health to fund this research and improve the chances for finding new treatments and cures .  as we have discussed , each year thousands of embryos no bigger than the head of a pin are created in the process of in vitro fertilization .  a small percentage of these embryos are implanted and , hopefully , become much-longed-for children .  some of the rest will be frozen , but most are discarded .  they will not be used to create life , they will never become children , they will be lost without purpose .  but under h.r. 810 , with the informed consent of the donor , under strict ethical guidelines , these embryos can be used to give life to millions of americans .  today , we can give this hope to millions who have little to hope for now .  this is an historic opportunity .  i urge my colleagues to do the right thing , to support lifesaving medical research .  support h.r. 810 .
