mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. chairman , there is probably not a member of this body that can not get up and tell some horror story with the current administration of the endangered species act .  we all agree there is need for reform and change .  the previous gentleman , while not speaking to the legislation whatsoever , should take note , and he has referred to the cost to a hospital in his district that had to pay some enormous costs , but it is important to realize anytime we allow species to go extinct we lose enormous potential to understand and improve our world and to create medicines that many times can save people 's lives .  nowhere is that more evident than in the world of medicine .  i have my chief of staff who has returned from the hospital , thank the lord to many medicines that have been produced from nearly extinct species .  it has made him well and brought him to this floor , and i could go down the list .  there are a number of important medicines , including possibly the next effective treatment of cancer , aids , or heart disease that can come from species that we are trying to protect and save on this world .
