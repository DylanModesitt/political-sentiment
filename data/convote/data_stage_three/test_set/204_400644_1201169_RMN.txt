mr. speaker , i thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding me this time .  we are here debating h.r. 810 , which directs the federal government to spend tax dollars on embryonic stem cell research .  this bill , therefore , implies that stem cell research is not already going on , but stem cell research is alive and well in america .  adult stem cells are currently being used to treat people , and successfully .  this bill 's approach , however , will remove stem cells from human embryos .  this will kill the embryo .  and whether we like to think about it or not , embryos are indeed human beings .  every human life begins as a human embryo ; and by extracting their stem cells , this bill uses american tax dollars to destroy human life .  the embryonic stem cell research in this bill destroys human life , and i believe that we as the american people should not destroy human life with american taxpayers ' dollars , not even in the name of research .
