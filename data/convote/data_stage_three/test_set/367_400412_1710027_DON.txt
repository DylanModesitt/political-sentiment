mr. speaker , i am not voting for this resolution , because i think it does not make a constructive contribution to the problems facing our country and the national economy .  the resolution says that trade restrictions and inequality are barriers to keeping and creating jobs in the united states -- but it does nothing about them , just as it does nothing to make it easier for americans looking for work to find good jobs .  the resolution says that bureaucratic red tape is a barrier to economic progress , but it does nothing to reduce that barrier or to require the bush administration to exercise leadership in reducing red tape .  the resolution says there is need for more innovation and investment , but it offers nothing substantive to promote innovation or to encourage more productive investment .  the resolution correctly says there is a need to overcome barriers to health care security , but it does nothing to help the millions of americans who lack health insurance or to make good health care more affordable .  the resolution says we need to promote lifelong learning , but is silent as to how to go about achieving that desirable result .  the resolution mentions taxes and the complexity of the tax laws , but provides no useful suggestions as to how to reduce that complexity or to promote tax fairness .  the resolution complains about `` lawsuit abuse '' and seems to support `` litigation management , '' but says nothing about the extent to which the courts can protect individual rights and the essential role of law in our society .  and while the resolution correctly says there is a need for greater energy self-sufficiency and security , it does nothing about it .  while that actually is an improvement over the energy-policy bill the house passed earlier this year , with its many wrong-headed provisions , it falls far short of what is needed .  in short , this resolution is not serious .  it deserves neither the time consumed in debating it nor approval by the house .  i will not vote for it .
