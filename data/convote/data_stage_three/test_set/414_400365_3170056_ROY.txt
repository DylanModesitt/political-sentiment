madam speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  madam speaker , the issue of national security letters was not in the patriot act that was enacted in 2001 .  they were enacted in 1986 in a bill that was written over in the other body .  this conference report puts procedural safeguards into national security letters even though they are not a part of the patriot act that was passed in 2001 .  it makes changes to all nsl provisions , not just electronic communications as the senate wanted .  it permits disclosure of nsls to legal counsel and those necessary to comply with the letter .  that is not in the law now .  it creates explicit access to judicial review of the government 's request for records .  it permits the reviewing court to modify or set aside the nsl if compliance would be unreasonable , oppressive or otherwise unlawful , the same standard for quashing a subpoena .  it permits judicial review of the nondisclosure requirement .  it creates a 5-year felony criminal penalty for unauthorized disclosures of nsls with intent to obstruct an investigation or judicial proceeding , just like the obstruction of justice statute .  the 1-year misdemeanor for disclosure without intent to obstruct , that is not in the conference reports .  that is out .  it requires the doj inspector general to conduct two audits of the fbi 's use of national security letters .  one audit covers 2003 and 2004 , the other 2005 and 2006 .  it requires the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to submit to congress a report on the feasibility of applying minimization procedures to nsl to ensure the protection of constitutional rights of united states persons , and it requires an annual public reporting on national security letters , including the aggregate number of requests made by the justice department for information concerning different u.s. persons .  now , national security letters are not subject to the sunset .  they are in the earlier law .  if the argument that has been advanced by the gentleman from new york succeeds , all of the protections i have just described go down the drain with the rest of the bill .  madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
