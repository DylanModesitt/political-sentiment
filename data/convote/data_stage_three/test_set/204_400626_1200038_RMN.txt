mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for yielding me time .  i want to congratulate the chairman and the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith )  and the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis )  for their leadership .  what we are doing with this legislation is that we are celebrating life and we are celebrating science .  our debate today and this bill , this bill is so very important because it is not often that politicians get it right when dealing with health care or science .  i know .  as a physician i have seen government inject itself in places it ought not go and spend countless dollars on fanciful and distorted claims .  however , h.r. 2520 will save lives and improve the quality of life for millions .  and i know this because it will increase the use of a science that has already been proven .  as a new member of congress , i am proud to stand before you and lend my support to a positive and productive piece of legislation that will bring sunlight to those who have experienced too many clouds , and it will do so in an unquestionable and ethical manner .  i commend the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton )  , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith )  , and the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis )  for their persistence , their cooperation , and their leadership .
