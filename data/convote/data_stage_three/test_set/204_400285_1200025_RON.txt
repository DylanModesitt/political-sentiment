mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for yielding his time .  you know , you can not divorce medical research from medical ethics .  and as such , it is critically important we are dealing here with medical facts .  first of all , although many members and the public and the media seem to get this wrong , the truth is , i believe we will have probably close to unanimous support for using federal dollars for stem cell research , but it is important to understand the different types : adult stem cell , which has much promise to harvest and grow these , although it has some risk for infections and other problems .  some 30 , 000 people have been treated .  umbilical cord , which is pluripotent .  it can be used in multiple ways .  over 6 , 000 cases have been treated .  frozen embryo research , zero .  and cloning has its own problems with that as well .  in the area of umbilical cord blood , one of the cases , because in my practice , i oftentimes dealt with children with developmental disabilities .  one case of the new england journal of medicine reports 90 percent success rate with hurley 's syndrome , a developmental disorder , autosomal dominant one , which ends up in severe developmental delays and death .  those are incredible results , incredible results that come from looking at the facts of what cord blood stem cell research is about .  let us not distort this discussion and confuse cord blood and embryonic , because when you are using cord blood , umbilical blood , you are not killing anyone .  you are not limiting or destroying a life .  you are taking something that has been discarded in the normal process of pregnancy and birth .  let us help support the continuation of this vital research which does not just show promise , but shows demonstrable results .  and it does not involve the ending of any life in the process .  this is where we should continue our research .  this is where we must continue our work .  this is where we must take our stand today , to continue to support medical research that is important .  look also at medical ethics .
