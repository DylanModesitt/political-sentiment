mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .  mr. speaker , the reform of the nation 's bankruptcy laws which our actions today will accomplish is well justified .  this reform is strongly in the interests of consumers .  it will significantly reduce the annual hidden tax of approximately $ 400 that the typical consumer pays because others are misusing the bankruptcy laws .  that amount represents the increased cost of credit and the increased price of goods and services caused by bankruptcy law misuse .  this reform will lower that hidden tax .  the reform also helps consumers by requiring clearer disclosures of the cost of credit on credit card statements , and the reform will be a major benefit to single parents who receive alimony or child support .  that person today is fifth in priority for the receipt of payment under the bankruptcy laws .  the reform before us today elevates the spouse support recipient to number one in priority .  this reform proceeds from the basic premise that people who can afford to repay a substantial portion of what they owe should do so .  the bill requires that repayment while allowing a discharge in bankruptcy of the debts that can not be repaid .  in so doing , it responds to the broad misuse of chapter 7 's complete liquidation provisions that we have observed in recent years .  the reform measure sets a threshold for the use of chapter 7. debtors who can make little or no repayment can use its provisions and discharge all of their debts .  debtors whose annual income is below the national mean of about $ 50 , 000 per year are untouched by this reform .  they can make full use of chapter 7 and discharge all of their debts , whether or not they can afford to make repayments .  this reform imposes a modest measure of personal responsibility that is well justified , and i urge its approval by the house .
