mr. speaker i rise in strong opposition to the misnamed `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , '' ( s. 256 ) .  current bankruptcy law needs some adjustment , but this bill is not the solution .  it hurts middle-class consumers in a variety of ways : the bill would allow landlords to evict battered women without bankruptcy court approval , even if the eviction poses a threat to the women 's physical well-being ; and , it permits credit card companies to reclaim common households goods which are of little value to them , but very important to the debtor 's family .  it is very important to note that the bill does absolutely nothing to discourage abusive underage lending , nothing to discourage reckless lending to the developmentally disabled and nothing to crack down on unscrupulous pay-day lenders that prey on members of the armed forces .  last year nearly one and a half million middle class individuals filed for bankruptcy .  their average income was less than $ 25 , 000 and the principal causes for their filings were layoffs , health problems and divorce .  in my judgment , it is a grave mistake to punish these individuals while rewarding credit card companies and business lobbyists at a time when corporate greed has already destroyed the lives of millions of american workers .  i will support a balanced bankruptcy reform bill , but s. 256 is in no way balanced and i believe does more harm than good , therefore i strongly oppose this bill .
