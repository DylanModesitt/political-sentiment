mr. speaker , i rise in favor of adult stem cell research , characterized by the gentleman from new jersey 's ( mr. smith )  bill , and oppose h.r. 810 , the castle legislation , that would propose federal dollars for destroying human embryos for embryonic stem cell research .  i can illustrate the difference with these two binders .  in this one binder there are 67 successful treatments using adult stem cells , and stem cells from cord blood , adult stem cells for treatment of diseases .  they are all categorized here by diseases , successful treatments .  from embryonic stem cell research : zero .  the simple fact of the matter is with the use of embryonic stem cells the only thing that you have today are dead embryos and dead laboratory rats with tumors .  they have not worked .  they do not work .  with adult stem cells you have live patients with treatments .  this is the ethical way to go .  this is what we should support .
