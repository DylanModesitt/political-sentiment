mr. chairman , i thank the chairman and the gentleman from california for allowing me to participate in this debate .  mr. chairman , i am somewhat perplexed and disappointed by the tactics from the other side .  this is serious business , and simply working to divide our citizens i believe to be counterproductive .  this bill , this bill , will enhance employment ; it will increase employment and job retention , plus increase the overall skill level of our labor force .  now , the demagoguery that you hear from the other side on this issue , and , frankly , on every issue , seemingly every issue , frankly is a disservice to this debate and does a disservice to our nation .  this bill gets more resources to the individual needing it .  that is a good thing .  these are very challenging times for many in our workforce .  they need more options for assistance , not a one-size-fits-all model or program .  streamlining the one-stop career center system is easier for the client .  that is a good thing .  it does not harm the wagner-peyser money .  there are no lost resources .  greater flexibility in the delivery of core , intensive , and training services allows individuals to receive the most appropriate services specifically for them .  that is a good thing .  providing personal reemployment accounts allows those who are unemployed an opportunity to use money for those things that are often that final hurdle to getting a new job , child care , transportation , housing assistance .  that is a good thing .  getting more resources to those most in need when they are out of school helps those without other opportunities , and that is a good thing .  faith-based language in this bill is identical , identical , to four separate pieces of legislation passed during the clinton administration .  there is no discrimination on the provision of services .  with this legislation , we are actively and positively addressing how the federal government , and ultimately how each and every citizen , will come together and lend a helping hand to those needing that assistance at a very pivotal time .  that is a good thing .  mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to support this bill and move forward in helping those needing to return to the workforce .  this is a good thing .
