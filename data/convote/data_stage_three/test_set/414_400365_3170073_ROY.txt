madam speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  madam speaker , the gentleman from michigan talked about the conclusive presumption provisions on national security letters that are contained in the conference report as well as the requirements that have been changed relative to section 215 , which is the business records or library provisions .  i would just point out that both the nsl provision and the section 215 provision in this respect were the language in the senate bill that passed unanimously .  and everybody here has been saying that the senate bill is great and the conference report is not .  but if the senate bill was great , now they are attacking two provisions in the senate bill .  they can not have it both ways .  what we did in the conference report is responsible .  with respect to section 215 , i wish that the library association had read it , because it requires the statement of facts in an application to the court that issues the 215 order to show reasonable grounds to believe that the records are relevant to an authorized investigation .  the senate 's language .  then it creates a presumption in favor of records that pertain to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power , activities of a suspected foreign power who is the subject of an authorized investigation , or an individual in contact with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of an authorized investigation .  now , all of these people are presumably bad folks that want to commit a terrorist attack , and i do not think we should make the libraries or any other place off limits to an investigation to try to see who is trying to blow innocent people up .
