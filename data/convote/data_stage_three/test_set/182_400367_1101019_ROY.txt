mr. speaker , we spoke earlier about how members provided information back and forth not only to the gentleman from california ( mr. cox )  and the homeland security department but also about how we were able to have a committee on rules meeting yesterday with thoughtful ideas that were presented yesterday .  our next speaker was a part of those thoughtful ideas .  he not only sat through hours of testimony , quizzing members about their questions and comments , things that would make things better , but also a few ideas himself .
