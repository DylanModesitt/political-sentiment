mr. speaker , i support this motion to recommit because it provides added financial protections for veterans , military personnel and their families who are enduring financial hardships as a direct result of serving this country .  additionally , this motion to recommit offers help to members of the reserves and national guard who all too often must leave behind their family jobs and businesses .  it provides protection not just during service but also for the 2 years after service when our veterans make the transition back to civilian life .  this measure will guarantee what the servicemembers relief act does not .  it will provide exemptions from the means test , financial assistance and time , something our servicemembers selflessly give to the nation and something we should give to them .  the servicemembers civil relief act does not provide substantial bankruptcy protections .  rather , it provides a simple , temporary 90-day delay in bankruptcy proceedings once a servicemember is released from active duty .  let us be clear .  no bankruptcy safe harbor or exemption exists for our citizen soldiers under the servicemembers civil relief act currently .  this motion is not an attempt to kill the bill .  it is simply a reaction to a real problem that has been highlighted in countless news stories , by the national military families association , disabled veterans of america , and individual servicemembers .  these are people experiencing real and difficult financial situations .  i support this motion to provide this narrow protection for those men and women who have served our country , and i urge my colleagues to do the same .  i thank my dear colleague for her efforts in this behalf .
