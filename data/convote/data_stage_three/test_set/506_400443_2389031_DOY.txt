mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time , and i wish to engage the chairman of the committee on resources in a colloquy .  for many years , mr. chairman , the u.s. army corps of engineers has engaged in river management practices that have harmed several species of native wildlife that live in and near the missouri river and undermine the economic livelihood of many communities along the upper missouri river basin .  my state , and others in the upper reaches of the basin , have repeatedly endeavored to influence the decisions of the corps as it makes critical river management decisions .  the interagency consultation provisions found in the current law are one of the few tools at our disposal .  so i am concerned that the alternative procedures defined but not specified in section 12 of the threatened and endangered species act would create a way for the corps to disregard the consultation requirement , and i want to make sure the alternative procedures provision is not designed as a way to eliminate consultation between federal agencies .  therefore , under the new bill , would the corps be required to manage the missouri river in a manner that meets current standards under the esa ?
