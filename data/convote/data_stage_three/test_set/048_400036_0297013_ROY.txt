mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. chairman , what we have before us is the reauthorization of the workforce investment act .  it was first passed in 1998 .  these one-stop centers that have been created all over the country to help the people gain skills and to increase their skills are a critical part of what we need to do if we are going to have a successful economy over the next 10 , 20 and even 50 years .  what we have done in this reauthorization is tried to make these one-stop centers work even better .  we believe that by consolidating the three separate funding streams , three different sets of employees , three different sets of books , we can gain more flexibility for the local workforce boards and thereby freeing up more dollars to be used to actually train workers .  we believe strongly that the youth services money here ought to be directed for the most part to out of school youth , a population that is vastly underserved and we do that in this bill .  we also believe that faith-based providers , especially in large urban centers , can provide a very necessary outreach to help those who are really needy have an opportunity to get the kind of training and retraining they need to become productive members of our society .  i think what we have here is a very good bill .  and while my friends on the other side of the aisle have some disagreement , i think all of us understand that by and large , this is a good program , that the bill before us is worth the support of my colleagues and i would ask them to do that .
