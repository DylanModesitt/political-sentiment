mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time , and i want to thank the majority leader and the speaker for bringing these two bills to the floor today .  the first vote we will have is on the cord blood and bone marrow bill , h.r. 2520 .  this bill , by itself , is an extremely important advance for those of us that believe you can use medical research ethically to help find cures for existing disease and enhance human life both now and in the future .  i am , obviously , as one of the original sponsors of the bill , going to vote for it and encourage all the members on both sides of the aisle to vote for its .  it is a good piece of legislation and , by itself , is a major advancement in the state of the art that we have today .  the next debate that we will have is on the castle-degette bill which is another form of stem cell research , embryonic stem cell .  that issue is much more controversial , but on its own merit that bill itself deserves a serious debate .  and while it is not yet time to debate that bill , at that time i will announce that i will vote for that bill also .  so i hope we can do first things first .  let us pass in a strong bipartisan fashion the smith-barton-young adult cord blood bone marrow bill , and then go on to the next issue .
