mr. chairman , i thank the chairman for this opportunity to address the patriot act .  we must especially make sure our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the resources they need to arrest , detain , and interrogate those who would do us harm before the deadly acts are committed .  i am very cognizant of the concerns brought to me by many of my constituents in michigan regarding the patriot act .  they have a concern which i believe we all share , that any legislation we pass to combat and prevent terror should not infringe upon the rights we cherish as americans , the very same freedoms the terrorists themselves seek to destroy .  i appreciate the gentleman letting me inquire about these provisions in the bill that you have reported out of committee .
