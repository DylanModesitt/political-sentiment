mr. speaker , you would not even exempt our brothers and sisters coming back from war , and you want me to believe that this is reasonable legislation ?  rising debt levels in turn reflect a shift in our economy away from a time when families could afford to save and into a time when their wages are stagnant .  the costs of their health premiums increased 163 percent since 1988 .  their tuitions have increased 170 percent .  their mortgages , their child care .  this is not a stable economy .  they are not crooks .  they are not evil people .  the american bankruptcy institute says that 96.3 percent of the people filing chapter 7 just do not have the money .  now we are not saying forget about all of this , but we are saying let us be reasonable .  who should we help ?  who should be first on the list of congressional priorities ?  the families who are in financial straits or the credit card companies who made a record $ 30 billion in profits last year and whose profits have soared almost triple in the last decade ?  this legislation does nothing to put caps on interest rates or late fees or the overtime limits and other penalties , even those among reasonable people .
