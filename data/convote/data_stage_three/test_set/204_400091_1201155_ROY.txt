mr. speaker , most of my colleagues that support this bill are from the pro-choice field .  i come at it from the pro-life section .  a lot of times i disagree with my colleagues because i think in some cases they would go further , and a fact that many people will not take under their wing is that many of these stem cells are going to be thrown away , either cryogenically they deteriorate and they throw them away , or a woman says `` i do n't want to keep them for 1 , 000 years '' and they discard them .  they literally throw them in the toilet .  now we can save life .  they say there is no good to be done .  animal studies have shown that work with the spinal cord , heart and others have been successful .  we have not done it on humans .  if you take a look at some of the blood diseases with bone marrow used , that is stem cell .  and we have hope in the future .  i met a young man that had aids at nih , and he only thought about dying .  he said , `` duke , all i need is hope to survive. '' this gives that hope , and i think it has promise .
