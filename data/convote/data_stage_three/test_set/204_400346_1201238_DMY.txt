mr. speaker , as a proud cosponsor of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , i rise in support of this legislation .  those of us who have long supported the increased accessibility and possibilities of ethical stem cell research appreciate the opportunity the leadership has granted us by allowing a vote on this legislation today .  i would also like to thank representatives castle and degette for their continued persistence to bring this bill to the floor .  we have all known someone who has suffered from lou gehrig 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , rett syndrome , lupus , pulmonary fibrosis , juvenile diabetes , autism , cystic fibrosis , osteoporosis , spinal cord injuries , heart disease or cancer .  by passing h.r. 810 , we have the opportunity to help all of those individuals who are living with these and many other illnesses and injuries .  embryonic stem cell research holds the key to decreasing the pain and suffering of so many of our friends and family members .  furthermore , we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to help the millions of americans , whose lives we hold in our hands , by allowing federal funding to be used for this promising research .  the authors of h.r. 810 have gone to great lengths to guarantee that safeguards are in place to ensure the ethical use of embryonic stem cells .  embryos used for stem cell research under h.r. 810 , will come from donor participation in in vitro fertilization , ivf , so embryos will not be created or cloned for research .  this legislation also directs the experts at the national institutes of health to define the boundaries of this research .  nih has stated that they are prepared to institute these parameters .  such restrictions will ensure that rogue scientists are not performing dangerous and unethical experiments .  the united states has long been the leader of groundbreaking health research .  today we have the opportunity to ensure that the rest of the world does not continue to take the lead in health care advances .  i urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 810 , not only because u.s. based researchers deserve to be at the forefront of the development of promising new treatments , but also for all of our constituents , friends , and family members who are counting on us to support the effort to find cures for so many different diseases and illnesses .
