mr. speaker , this bill represents a new low .  wasteful drilling in the arctic and dismantling the clean air act are bad enough , but now the republican majority wants to weaken the endangered species act , weaken it by handing out subsidies to oil and gas companies and land speculators for not killing endangered species , meaning taxpayers will be giving money to these land developers for simply following the law or for taking a risk by making a big investment in land so they can sell it at a higher price .  what next ?  will taxpayers be asked to foot the bill to pay companies to follow other laws of the land ?  mr. speaker , i know we can do better .  protecting our endangered species is never easy , but if we do not do it right , if we do not depend on sound science , if instead we yield to greed and politics , there is no second chance .  i urge my colleagues to vote against the bill and protect the environment for our children and their children and vote for the bipartisan substitute .
