mr. chairman , the part that i have trouble with is that we did not authorize any new money to fund this .  you just said , take it out of the interior appropriations bill .  well , i want to tell you , we have not funded the endangered species act properly under this administration , and if there is not any money , it is going to have to come out of somebody else 's hide .  it is going to be the fish and wildlife service , it is going to be the park service ; somebody is going to have to fund this , and it is going to cost a lot more than $ 10 million a year .  that is laughable .
