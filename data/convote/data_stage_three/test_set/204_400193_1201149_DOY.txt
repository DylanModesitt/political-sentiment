mr. speaker , i come to speak for life , life for people with diabetes , life for people with parkinson 's , life for people with damaged hearts .  what possible benefit is it for life to discard these cells without allowing them to be used to bring life , to save life , to preserve life ?  if these cells have any future , it is through curing disease .  if members wish to give them life , then let them give life to others .  this is their only hope , and it is our best hope .  dr .  connie davis , the medical director of university of washington 's kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant program , put this discussion in perspective when i was talking to her yesterday .  she reminded me that the donation of a kidney used to be a controversial issue in this country .  it is no longer so .  our bill allows donors of these stem cells to make a donation decision , a donation to research .  a narrow segment of our nation did not stop lifesaving kidney donations , and a narrow segment should not stop embryonic stem cell research .  healing is a moral thing to do .  i met a man at the transplant association the other day .  he and his wife had , in fact , had an in vitro fertilization .  he had other additional embryos that were available .  he wanted to make those available to cure people with diabetes and parkinson 's disease , and he had one thing he asked me .  he said to me , let me and my wife make that moral judgment , not the 435 strangers who know nothing about my moral interior values or my life .  that is an american right to donation .  we should preserve it and pass this bill .
