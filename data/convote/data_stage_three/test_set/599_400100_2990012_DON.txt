mr. speaker , i thank the gentlemen for yielding me time .  despite what the member from florida said , there are some who would like to speak to this issue .  he said what does 30 days matter ?  should it be 29 ?  guess what ?  the congress assembled on behalf of the american people , and this administration will borrow $ 1.3 billion a day every day for those 30 days .  we will be $ 39 billion deeper in debt a month from today .  what would we do if we had an open rule ?  well , perhaps we could make some real cuts in wasteful programs in the budget , instead of attacking the vulnerable , the students , kids getting lunches at school .  they are just eating too much .  kids in foster care , long term care for seniors .  maybe we could go where the real money is .  they asked willie sutton , why did you rob banks ?  because that is where the money is .  the republicans do not want to go where the money is because that is where the special interests are , the people who fund their campaign machine to keep them in the majority , to keep them borrowing $ 1.3 billion a day , indebting the american people as far as the eye can see .  what cuts might we have to make ?  well , let us see .  the president has this bizarre idea that we should borrow a trillion dollars , one thousand billion dollars to go to mars while we can not meet the needs of people here on earth , here in the united states of america .  we do not have money for levees , jetties .  we do not have money for the school lunch program .  we do not have money for student loans , but we should borrow a trillion dollars to go to mars .  but before that , let us borrow $ 100 billion to go back to the moon to get some more dust .  great idea .  no , personally , i would like to have an up or down vote on borrowing $ 100 billion to go back to the moon .  a few other things , let us revisit star wars .  the general in charge of star wars gave us some very , very encouraging news .  he said the system to protect us against missiles that will never be fired against the united states because we could track them back and retaliate , they will smuggle a bomb in if they want to attack us .  but he said it has a better than zero chance of working , better than zero after $ 100 billion and abrogating the anti-missile treaty .  whoa , that is good .  well , maybe we could visit that issue in an open rule .  how about corporate farm subsidies ?  the american people are going to borrow around $ 25 billion this year to give subsidies for surplus crops being grown by corporate farmers and others .  well , maybe we could visit that issue on the floor .  no , they would not want to touch that .  there is a lot of money coming in there .  how about the $ 19 billion in the energy bill in subsidies to the oil industry in the hope that they will take money , borrowed by the taxpayers , given to them to go out and explore ?  of course , those same oil company execs , of course they were not under oath , i have got to admit that , said that that money , the head of exxon said it is nothing , it is chump change , and it has no effect on our operations .  so maybe we could take back that $ 19 billion and spend it on lunch for hungry kids or maybe we could put the money back into the student loan program that you want to cut out in the reconciliation bill .  then we have a few tax giveaways out there , offshore companies like accenture , largest homeland security contractor in the history of the united states , $ 10 billion , who has moved their headquarters to the bahamas so they will not pay any taxes in the united states of america , but they are going to defend us against foreign enemies , but they just do not want to pay any taxes here .  i would like to be defended against them and those giveaways .
