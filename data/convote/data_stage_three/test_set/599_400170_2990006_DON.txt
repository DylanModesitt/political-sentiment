mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , i would inform my good friend from florida that getting up for a 7 a.m .  rules committee does not alter my temperament .  the suggestion that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should have completed their work by september 30 is mandated by our responsibilities here in the house of representatives .  and i find it disingenuous to speak of the other body , which i heartily endorse what my colleague said with reference to the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis )  in this house of representatives but the other body is controlled by the majority .  the white house is controlled by the majority .  and it is y'all that have it all .  and so under the circumstances , it is your responsibility to have done it by september 30 .  to answer the gentleman , what we would have done perhaps if we did not go home for thanksgiving and take thanksgiving dinner up here .  the gentleman asks for another date or debate about this continuing resolution , doubtless what we would have been able to do is stay here and that may have lit a fire under some of the people in the other body who need to get their work done .  we have all sorts of problems in this nation and there is no reason for us not to complete our work .
