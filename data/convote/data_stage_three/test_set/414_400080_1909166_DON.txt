mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott )  for yielding me time .  could i ask the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott )  or the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt )  , is this not kind of unusual ?  there have been no hearings and we are combining the death penalty by putting together two substantial terrorist crimes , section 1992 and 1993 .  well , maybe i should ask the author of the bill , if he is on the floor , why this has not had committee consideration .
