mr. speaker , i would like to thank the gentleman from michigan for offering this motion to recommit .  mr. speaker , we have asked literally hundreds of thousands of our best and brightest , many of them national guard and reservists from south dakota , to serve overseas in operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom .  we owe these brave men and women and their families a great deal for their sacrifice during these difficult times .  what we owe them is the opportunity to make good on the american dream that they have fought to defend .  this motion would create an economic transition benefit , similar to trade adjustment act assistance , for service members returning from iraq and afghanistan who find themselves without employment .  additionally , too many of the brave men and women who are serving in the national guard and reserve forces have returned home to find their jobs gone and their families struggling to make ends meet .  while our military personnel are risking their lives in iraq and afghanistan , they should not be worrying if their jobs will be there for them when they return home or what they will do if they are not .  this motion to recommit would provide unemployed veterans of iraq and afghanistan with income support and intensive employment training and job relocation assistance so that they can successfully transition back into civilian life .  i ask my colleagues to support this motion to recommit .  our returning servicemembers from iraq and afghanistan deserve no less .
