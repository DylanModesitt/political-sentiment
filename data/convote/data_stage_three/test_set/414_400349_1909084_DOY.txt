mr. chairman , we are all watching what is happening in london ; and with that backdrop , we are discussing reauthorizing the patriot act today .  we are all committed to finding and fighting terrorists .  no one party , democrats or republicans , has exclusivity over this issue .  we are all for stopping terrorists and protecting our citizens .  while we are all committed to this fight , it is still our congressional duty to exercise our oversight responsibilities .  we can do this effectively with sunset provisions .  sunset provisions hold congress accountable for reexamining and determining the effectiveness and impact of the patriot act .  as a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence , i hold this oversight responsibility as one , if not my most , important function .  let me say up front that i think the patriot act provides essential tools for law enforcement authorities that were not available before the 9/11 attacks .  these tools are essential to identifying and tracking terrorists inside the united states .  the house permanent select committee on intelligence held two open hearings for the patriot act .  these hearings led me to conclude that the patriot act , while good , is not perfect .  additional time is needed to assess many of these provisions ' effectiveness and impact on civil liberties , and that is why we need to call for sunsets .  it is clear to me that we still face serious threats and we need some of the powers of the patriot act .  sunset provisions are important because they allow for review and oversight .  oversight allows us to protect civil liberties ; but more importantly , it allows us to enhance law enforcement tools to keep pace with the terrorists .
