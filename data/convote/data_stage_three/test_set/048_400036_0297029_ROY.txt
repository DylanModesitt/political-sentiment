mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume just to correct the record .  the gentlewoman who just spoke says that we eliminated a preference for veterans in this bill .  the fact is that there is a preference for veterans written into the law .  that has not changed at all .  secondly , the gentlewoman said there are block grants in the underlying bill .  there are no block grants .  as a matter of fact , the targeting of funds to the local workforce boards in this bill is more structured than it is today under current law , so that at least 75 percent of the funds available back to the states must go to the local workforce investment boards .  lastly , the gentlewoman said that we have discrimination in this bill .  i would just remind the gentlewoman that when our predecessors wrote the 1964 civil rights act , they recognized in title vii that religious organizations ought to be protected in their hiring so that they would not be required to hire anybody that shows up , but could , if they wanted to , only hire those people within their faith .  now , if people want to disagree with title vii of the 1964 civil rights act , they certainly have that right .  they may go to the committee on the judiciary and change that law , but let us not try to do it in this bill .
