mr. speaker , i stand today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 .  one of the few places this is really an extremely controversial bill is right here because the majority of americans strongly support embryonic stem cell research .  they want the federal government to fund research that is critical for some 128 million americans who suffer from juvenile diabetes , parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , cancer , heart disease , spinal cord injuries , als , and other diseases .  stem cell research is a medical issue , one that should and fortunately does transcend political lines and instead focuses on human lives .  one such life is that of clara livingston , a 9-year-old girl with diabetes .  during her testimony last week in a hearing in chicago , clara said , `` there are things i do n't like about diabetes .  i have to put a one-inch needle into my skin to connect my insulin pump .  i do n't like pricks or shots .  i do n't like having high blood sugar and not being able to eat .  i do n't like going low and fainting. '' she continued , `` i would like to find a cure because finding a cure will help make america and the rest of the world not worry about diabetes. '' most scientists agree that embryonic stem cell research offers the greatest hope to patients like clara .  there are limitations on the usefulness of adult stem cells when compared to embryonic stem cells .  for example , there are no adult stem cells in the pancreas .  that means that adult stem cell research will be inadequate in helping clara or any other patients who are patients hoping for a cure for diabetes .  while it is important to continue working with adult stem cells , it is also vital to fund the research funding embryonic stem cells .  we do a grave disservice to millions of children and adults living with serious illness , as well as the millions who will develop these conditions in the future , by prohibiting promising research .  this bill will lift these arbitrary restrictions and permit funding of cell lines regardless of where they were created .  federal funding guidelines assure that research will meet ethical standards and allow advancements to be made as quickly as possible .  as steven teitelbaum of washington university in st .  louis said , `` this is not a contest between adult and embryonic stem cells .  this is a contest between us as a society and disease. '' i hope my colleagues will vote `` yes '' on this bipartisan legislation .
