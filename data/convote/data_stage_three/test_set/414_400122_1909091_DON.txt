mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time .  mr. chairman , i voted for the first patriot act , and i strongly supported the creation of the homeland security department and have voted for every large increase in intelligence , homeland security funding , and defense funding .  but i am very troubled here .  i am very troubled by the fact that we are eliminating the sunsets .  i am very troubled by the fact that the administration and the leadership here are just going full steam ahead without listening to the very sincere problems that many of us have with the erosion of civil liberties .  i do not think we should be trying to save our freedom by killing the safeguards that keep our liberties .  these are very serious issues .  the fbi can get a court order to demand confidential medical and financial records and gag their doctor or banker from telling them .  they can even search people 's homes and not tell them until weeks or months later .  we have had many colleagues talk about the problems with library records and bookstore records .  these are very serious civil liberties problems .  and it is not on the abstract .  there are people like me who support a strong defense .  there are people like me who support strong intelligence and homeland security funding .  but this is a balancing act , and my fear is that we have gone too far .  the administration should listen to us , have a moderate bill , have sunsets , and then we could all vote for this bill .
