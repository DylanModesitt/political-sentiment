mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 .  i commend my colleague , the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette )  , for her leadership on this issue .  stem cell research is not about abortion .  stem cell research is not about human cloning .  we are talking about finding cures for alzheimer 's , paralysis , parkinson 's , and other diseases .  we are talking about improving the lives of countless numbers of people in this country .  that is what stem cell research is about .  we are talking about putting american health care and researchers in the best position to finding the cures for today 's diseases tomorrow and to preventing the diseases of tomorrow today .  this spring , i joined my colleague , the gentleman from new york ( mr. israel )  , for a congressional roundtable on stem cells and on the biotech industry .  doctors , researchers , and scientists spoke about how the president 's strict limits on stem cell research is prohibiting them from conducting the level of research that they would like to do .  i agree , but who is missing out the most are the 650 , 000 people we represent and the potential this research holds .  american medical research has extended lives through immunization , treatments , and innovations .  from eradicating polio to advances in diabetes , american research has been on the forefront .  but there is still so much more that can be done and much more potential that exists .  i commend my colleagues again for this bill being on the floor , and i support it wholeheartedly .
