mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  we have had a number of our colleagues make observations , just as the gentleman from oregon did , about the importance of not only the debate that takes place here in the house but also about our desire to make homeland security even better , more robust , more dynamic , aiming at the threat .  we heard the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier )  talk very eloquently about the need for border control , for us to make sure that those people who might be terrorists or may be criminals entering this country .  i am sure we will hear a debate about cargo , cargo ships , thousands of containers that come to this country every day , the commerce of this country that is affected .  we know that we talked yesterday in the committee on rules about the canadian border and how the canadian border needs the attention that they not only deserve but also with the flow of goods and services with the economies that are affected and products and services that are denied when the backlogs occur .  each of these has been a part of the arguments , the debates , the discussions that the gentleman from california ( mr. cox )  has taken into account , has made sure that he has taken them to the homeland security department , has spoken with the administration .  it just makes me very proud today to see our members who are able to cogently come up with not only good answers and better decision-making processes but an abiding faith in what we are doing here today .  i am proud that this debate , some 5 hours of debate that will take place today about this very important subject where members of congress are able to come down and really identify their specific suggestions that they have .  i think this process works .  i think the committee on rules was wise in what it did .  i think the gentleman from california knew when he put together this rule with our leadership what it would look like .  it is working today .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
