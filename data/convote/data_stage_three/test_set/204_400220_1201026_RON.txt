mr. speaker , i thank the leader for yielding me this time .  i ask myself this question : if we are going to deal with this debate on embryonic stem cell research , what are the ethics of this ?  one can go to google and do a google search on permissible medical experiments .  and i did that , and i found that there is a list of 10 things that have to be qualifiers for permissible medical experiments on human beings .  one is the subject must be a volunteer .  the second one is there must be no alternative .  the third one is results of animal experimentation must be proven successful prior to their experiments .  the net result in death or disability can not be accepted .  the seventh one is there can not be even a remote possibility of injury , disability , or death .  the human subject must be at liberty to end the experiment .  and the likely result can not be injury , disability , or death .  the exception is if a physician wants to experiment upon himself .  where do i find this information , mr. speaker ?  i find this information in the military tribunals under control council law no .  10 , october , 1946 , nuremberg .
