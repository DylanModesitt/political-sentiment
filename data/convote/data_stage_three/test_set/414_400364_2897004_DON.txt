madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct .  the current house bill provisions for 10 year sunsets on the 215 and 206 roving wiretap powers is not much better than no sunset at all .  what we are talking about under the 215 provision is power to get access to your personal records from a business , including a public library , without you ever knowing about it , or what is done with the information .  and the librarian or other business operator can not tell you or anyone else other than the business 's attorney or appropriate superiors , about the fbi 's taking your records .  under the roving wiretaps provision , after obtaining a roving wiretap from the secret fisa court , the fbi can follow the target around and tap any phone the target has access to , including yours if he or she happens to be a neighbor and comes to your house , without having to first determine that the phone is actually being used by the target before they start listening in .  the 4-year sunsets worked to make the justice department responsive to congress in providing the information needed to properly perform its oversight responsibility for the extraordinary powers extended under the patriot act , but only in the last year of the sunset .  for most of the 4-year period leading up to the sunsets , the justice department refused any meaningful oversight of their patriot act powers and other war on terror authorities .  even with chairman sensenbrenner threatening a subpoena because he was not getting answers to his patriot act questions , it was n't until the powers were set to expire that we got real answers -- hard numbers and at least anecdotal evidence of their use .  take , for example , the effort to try to get information about library record requests under the secretive section 215 powers where the recipient of the order is gagged from disclosing any information about it : first we were told that information about even the number of these orders was secret , so it could n't be disclosed .  it was only in the last year of the sunset that we were finally told that there had been no 215 orders issued to libraries , then we learned that this was misleading because most libraries cooperated with fbi requests for information without requiring a 215 order , and with all the secrecy and gag orders in effect , we still do n't know what the full story is .  perhaps some of the pending lawsuits will finally reveal what has been going on in this area .  the problem with a 10-year sunset is that it will have no impact on the current administration , or the next one and only have an impact in the last year of the 3rd administration from now .  moreover , with a 20-year retirement period for most career officials , in 10 years most of today 's officials will have retired .  so , that 's really of little oversight value if we have to wait that long to get the kind of responsive information for oversight we were finally able to get in the last year of the current sunsets .  accordingly , we should accede to the senate sunset provisions which call for 4-year sunsets on the three most controversial and worrisome patriot powers -- secret acquisition of library and other business records , roving wiretaps , and the `` lone wolf '' provision for terrorism investigations , which allows a single individual to fall under the extraordinary , secretly administered foreign surveillance powers otherwise reserved for use against agents of foreign governments or organizations .
