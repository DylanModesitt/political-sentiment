mr. chairman , i would just note that we have spent since 9/11 only a couple hundred million dollars in homeland security to secure our rail systems .  that is the real problem here .  we spent nearly $ 25 billion on air security and a couple of hundred million on rail .  i would also not that although i do not oppose the death penalty , i doubt very much the death penalty is going to deter the suicide bombers .  i think we need to look at not deterrents but at actually preventing the terrorists from harming americans by protecting the systems and putting our money where our mouth is and in securing these rail systems which we have failed to do .  as my colleague on the committee on the judiciary knows , i also serve on the committee on homeland security .  we are well aware of how deficient our efforts have been in this regard .  that is the crux of this problem , not threatening suicide bombers with the death penalty .
