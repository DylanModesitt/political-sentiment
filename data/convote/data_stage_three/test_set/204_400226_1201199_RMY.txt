mr. speaker , i do rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 .  over the past two decades , three-quarters of the scientists who have won the nobel prize in medicine have studied or taught in the united states .  and this is not a coincidence .  our nation has created an environment that values innovation and discovery , especially in biological sciences .  h.r. 810 will help america continue to lead in this crucial field .  of course , there is more at stake in this debate than america 's global standing .  stem cell research holds extraordinary potential to save lives and alleviate human suffering .  i had a father who suffered from parkinson 's , a mother who passed away with alzheimer 's .  and i am all the more convinced that we must pursue this research vigorously , because i believe it does have potential to yield results .  i would argue that h.r. 810 is worthy of our support not just for what it allows but for what it restricts .  the bill requires that embryos be in excess of clinical need .  it does not permit financial compensation for those embryos , and it requires the donor 's written , informed consent .  this legislation appeals to hope , but it insists on caution as well .  h.r. 810 is as thoughtful as it is ambitious .  for that reason i urge my colleagues to support it .
