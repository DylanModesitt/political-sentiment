mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me time , and especially i rise to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for his tireless efforts on behalf of the security and the liberty of the american people in developing this reauthorizing legislation .  today in london we have seen yet again the work of terrorists on the soil of a freedom-loving people .  the explosions in that city today , while less lethal than a few weeks ago , follow the deadly attacks that took place on july 7 , and the anguish in london is a vivid reminder of why we can not relent in taking the steps necessary to defend our homeland from a present terrorist threat .  we all lived through september 11 .  i was here at the capitol that day .  i saw the evil of our enemies written in the smoke rising above the pentagon .  and we are reminded yet today that their desire to do such violence in our homeland and in the homeland of our allies is real .  the patriot act is essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home .  in the last 4 years under the patriot act , we have seen a great increase in the ability of law enforcement officials to investigate and track terrorists .  for example , aided by provisions of the patriot act , law enforcement officials in ohio were able to arrest iyman faris , an ohio truck driver who authorities said plotted attacks on the brooklyn bridge and a central ohio shopping mall .  in 2003 , he pleaded guilty to charges of aiding and abetting terrorism and conspiracy , acknowledging that he had met with osama bin laden in the year 2000 at an al qaeda training camp and then was provided assistance by al qaeda .  he is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence .  while 16 provisions of the patriot act are set to expire at the end of this year , the threat of terrorism to our families and our cities will not .  therefore , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 is as necessary today as the patriot act was when it was originally signed into law in october of 2001 .  this reauthorization legislation does make permanent 14 of the 16 sections from the original patriot act that were set to expire this year .  but under the bill , those sections of the act that have caused the greatest concern in the hearts of many millions of americans are set to sunset , sections 206 and 215 , within 10 years , thanks to the leadership of this committee and of this congress .  the concerns that have been raised about abuses simply have not been borne out .  with over 4 years of oversight hearings and six department of justice inspector general reports , there is no evidence of abuse under the patriot act .  i know what the people of london are feeling today .  i felt it that day , september 11 , and my heart and my prayers go out to them .  i am absolutely convinced that what we have done in this country in a bipartisan way has contributed mightily to the fact that there has not been another major terrorist event in our nation since that awful day .  the patriot act and the elements which we will reauthorize today are central to the ongoing victory in the war on terror , and i urge its adoption .
