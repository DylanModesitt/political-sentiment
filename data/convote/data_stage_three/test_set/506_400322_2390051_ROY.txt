mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of the time .  mr. chairman , i say to my friend from west virginia , i appreciate all the work that he and his staff put into this bill .  this was an important thing for us to go through , and i think that we produced a good bill at the end of that .  i know that there are issues in the underlying bill that we disagree on , and we probably always will .  i will tell the gentleman , as we continue to work forward , i will continue to work with the gentleman as this bill moves through the process , continue to work with the gentleman and try to work out whatever differences that still exist under the bill .  the gentleman from west virginia operated under good faith with me , i believe i did the same thing with the gentleman throughout this entire process , and i pledge to the gentleman that we will continue to work together to produce the best possible bipartisan bill we can to deliver to the president 's desk .
