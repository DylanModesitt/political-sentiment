mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act , which will reauthorize the workforce investment act ( wia ) -- programs which provide job training for youths , veterans , and seasonal and migrant workers .  for the past six years wia has offered a `` one-stop delivery system '' through which job-seekers have access to labor market information , job counseling , and job training .  in addition , they have access to numerous other federal programs that provide services for job seekers .  with facilities in wilmington , newark , dover and georgetown , the `` one-stop delivery system '' in delaware has proved to be an efficient tool in training individuals for the workforce .  for example , in delaware all of our centers are fully equipped with : internet ready computers , interactive cd-rom tutorials , fax machine to send resume and cover letters to perspective employers , copy machine , telephone resource center with career manuals including reference books .  delaware also runs an internet site where applicants can post resumes , as well as to search a comprehensive database of job openings .  applicants can also allow job scout to search the system for you automatically track wages and trends , training locations and funding available .  it also offers bus schedules , links to newspaper classified ads , child care and related information through the family and workplace connection .  the purpose of highlighting the program in delaware is to provide a real life example of useful it is to have services in one central place .  the bill before us today builds on the efficiency of the `` one-stop delivery '' model by streamlining unnecessary bureaucracy , eliminating duplication , strengthening resource allocation , and improving accountability .  i am pleased that we are able to make reforms that build upon successes , and that will ultimately enhance the ability of adults to access services that lead to employment .  i would also like to briefly touch upon the services that are provided for youth under this bill .  under this legislation youth between the ages of 16 and 24 are eligible for a variety of services geared toward graduating high school or gaining the skills necessary for employment .  the importance of these services can not be overstated to these young adults .  with that , i thank the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) and the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) , and urge my colleagues to support h.r. 27 .
