mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , as this debate has gone on , and it has been a good discussion here today , i think it is worthwhile to come back to where we are on this whole issue here .  the embryonic stem cell research we are debating here today is controversial because of the means of obtaining these cells .  research involving most types of stem cells , those derived from adult tissues or the umbilical cord , is uncontroversial except , as we saw , the second issue here today is , how effective is it ?  is embryonic more effective than cord ?  are embryonic stem cells more effective in treating injuries and illnesses than the adult tissue stem cells ?  so we sort of have a two-pronged argument here yet : how do you obtain the stem cells and , secondly , the effectiveness of adult versus embryonic stem cells .  but i think in this whole issue here , we sort of lose questions .  before we even get to those questions , i think we should look at it and say , what is the ethical consideration of the human nature , and that should be the first question we should ask , not what are the means we obtain it by , what is left over when we obtain the embryonic stem cells , or what is its effectiveness .  i think we have to look at the ethical considerations .  because cloning is one method to produce embryos for research , the ethical issues surrounding cloning are also relevant .  in fact , i believe those ethical issues should really be the first question we should ask before we debate the means of obtaining , or even the effectiveness of the proposed treatment .  i would hope that life would triumph hope and the question is really before we even get into effectiveness or means , but what is the human nature consideration ?  that should be the first question we should answer .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
