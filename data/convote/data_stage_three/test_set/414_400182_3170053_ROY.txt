madam speaker , i rise in strong support of the conference report .  today , our country is at war .  we are at war against a global enemy , the global enemy of terrorism .  beginning long before the 9/11 attacks , our citizens have faced potential threats to our safety and security at home within the united states for the first time since pearl harbor .  we are reminded on a daily basis around the world that those threats are real , serious , and continuing .  as chairman of the intelligence committee , i want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that the central purpose of this bill is to provide enhanced intelligence authorities to combat spies and terrorists within the united states .  we have many national intelligence capabilities , but the authorities that are enhanced by the patriot act are among the most crucial because they protect the american people from terrorist threats here at home .  they are a crucial part of our efforts to build a strong domestic national security capability within the fbi .  i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in this conference and on this important legislation .  the conference report under consideration today will make 14 of 16 provisions of the patriot act permanent while also including sensible clarifications and improvements in many areas where there should be broad , bipartisan agreement .  by the justice department 's count , the bill adds 30 new safeguards to protect privacy and civil liberties .  these include a clearer standard for obtaining certain business records , clarification that that authority may be subject to judicial review , and much more specific standards with respect to the use of national security letters and roving wire taps .  in addition , the congress will continue its close and continued oversight with the intelligence committee paying particular attention to the specific manner in which these authorities are used .  madam speaker , this bill needs to be approved .  i encourage my colleagues to support this conference report and work to keep america safe .
