we do have a very , very full schedule over the next few weeks .  as the gentleman knows and most of the members know , the appropriations committee is trying their best to get all the appropriations bills out of the house before the july 4 break , so there is very little time between now and the fourth of july to do other bills .  we are considering the head start bill , but we do not have any immediate plans to consider the head start bill reauthorization and hope that we can get to it as soon as possible .
