mr. speaker , the outsourcing of good-paying american jobs to other countries is a crisis that touches every community in the united states .  up to half a million jobs have been outsourced over the past 3 years to countries like china , india , and mexico .  this at a time when there are 8 million americans out of work .  americans now understand that outsourcing negatively impacts every segment of our economy .  not only have 2.7 million jobs been lost in our once-vibrant manufacturing sector since the beginning of this administration but white collar jobs are being offshored as well .  according to one report , 181 , 000 computer jobs will be moved offshore by the end of 2005 .  last year , state and local governments outsourced $ 10 billion of public projects .  what we are witnessing today is a full-scale erosion of the american workforce , with millions seeking skills to improve their current employment situation .  this bill undermines our job training system and our economy alike .  this motion seeks to provide assistance to veterans , provide workers who lost their jobs to outsourcing with job training assistance , allowances to relocate to where they can find work and other forms of income support .  this bill destroys the functioning elements of our job training system .  it does not , quote , improve our delivery of these vital services for unemployed americans .  i urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit .
