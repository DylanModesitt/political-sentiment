mr. speaker , the issue of government funding of embryonic stem cell research is one of the most divisive issues facing the country .  while i sympathize with those who see embryonic stem cell research as providing a path to a cure for the dreadful diseases that have stricken so many americans , i strongly object to forcing those americans who believe embryonic stem cell research is immoral to subsidize such research with their tax dollars .  the main question that should concern congress today is does the united states government have the constitutional authority to fund any form of stem cell research .  the clear answer to that question is no .  a proper constitutional position would reject federal funding for stem cell research , while allowing the individual states and private citizens to decide whether to permit , ban , or fund this research .  therefore , i will vote against h.r. 810 .  unfortunately , many opponents of embryonic stem cell research are disregarding the constitution by supporting h.r. 2520 , an `` acceptable '' alternative that funds umbilical-cord stem cell research .  while this approach is much less objectionable than funding embryonic stem cell research , it is still unconstitutional .  therefore , i must also oppose h.r. 2520 .  federal funding of medical research guarantees the politicization of decisions about what types of research for what diseases will be funded .  thus , scarce resources will be allocated according to who has the most effective lobby rather than allocated on the basis of need or even likely success .  federal funding will also cause researchers to neglect potential treatments and cures that do not qualify for federal funds .  ironically , an example of this process may be found in h.r. 2520 ; some research indicates that adult stem cells may be as useful or more useful to medical science than either embryonic or umbilical cord stem cells .  in fact , the supporters of embryonic stem cell research may have a point when they question the effectiveness of umbilical cord mr. speaker , there is no question that h.r. 810 violates basic constitutional principles by forcing taxpayers to subsidize embryonic stem cell research .  however , h.r. 2520 also exceeds congress 's constitutional authority and may even retard effective adult stem cell research .  therefore , i urge my colleagues to vote against both h.r. 810 and h.r. 2520 .
