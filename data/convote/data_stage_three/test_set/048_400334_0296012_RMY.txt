mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act of 2005 .  i would like to recognize the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner )  and the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon )  for their leadership and tireless efforts in bringing this bill to the house floor .  hard-working families in my district who have been laid off rely on programs like the one-stop workforce development system , which helps states and communities ensure workers to get the training they need to find good jobs .  i like to call the one-stops `` hope centers '' because they provide hope to people seeking gainful employment .  for example , my constituent , jeff ring , who after 24 years of employment as a steelworker , was laid off .  he is a father of three children , eight and younger .  he came to the one-stop and enrolled in training to become a registered nurse .  just last week he received his certification and will begin working at aultman hospital and will be making nearly 20 percent more than his previous salary .  in another case , my constituent , tiffany birtalan , a single mother raising a teenager , she currently works as a waitress making $ 2.13 an hour plus tips .  she came to the local one-stop seeking to change careers .  tiffany is now enrolled at a community college and is training to be a dental hygienist .  based on current labor market information and the high demand for this occupation , she will easily make $ 25 to $ 30 per hour .  every day , every day , hard-working people like jeff and tiffany walk through the doors of one-stop across the country seeking assistance .  we must do all we can to streamline unnecessary bureaucracy and strengthen allocations so that adequate resources are available to them achieve their hopes and dreams .  mr. chairman , this is a good bill , and i would urge my colleagues to support h.r. 27 .
