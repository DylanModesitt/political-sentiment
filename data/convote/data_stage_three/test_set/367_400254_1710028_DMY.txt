mr. speaker , i voted for h. res. 352 because i agree that there are barriers to keeping and creating jobs within the united states and that federal agencies ought to review their rules and policies to improve the competitiveness of our economy .  but i do not associate myself with the sense of the `` whereas '' clauses that america must adopt foreign values and standards in order to compete economically .  i also note that the `` whereas '' clauses include partisan distortions and falsehoods that are an ill-considered disservice to the cause of american competitiveness .
