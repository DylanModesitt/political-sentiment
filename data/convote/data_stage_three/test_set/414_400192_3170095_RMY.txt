madam speaker , i am very pleased with the conference report , h.r. 3199 , to renew the patriot act .  i want to thank and compliment all the conferees and the administration for bringing this about .  by renewing this measure , we are continuing to provide our law enforcement agencies and the administration with many of the critical tools needed to combat global terrorism and protect america .  provisions of the patriot act have already been instrumental in warding off further terrorist attacks since 9/11 , and they are responsible for helping to keep us safe here at home .  in addition , the bill includes an added provision , which i authored , offering a new tool to attack the growing phenomenon of narco-terrorism , with the proceeds of illicit drug funding and financing feeding the foreign terrorist organizations , ftos , and supporting acts of terrorism .  passage of the patriot act conference report will enhance federal criminal law to effectively address the current reality , according to the drug enforcement administration , of illicit drugs being linked to nearly half of the designated ftos around the globe today .  in this measure , my provision makes narco-terrorism , which involves both the illicit drug trade and support for terrorism , a federal crime , and provides tough penalties that match the nature of such deadly and dual criminal activity .  our hardworking drug enforcement administration will no longer be challenged to produce evidence of a nexus of these illicit drugs to the united states , if there is proof that the illicit drugs support ftos or acts of terrorism .  in afghanistan , most of the heroin from illicit drug production goes to europe , rather than here , and much of the profit then finances and supports anticoalition terrorists and attacks on our forces there .  my provision will give us the tools to attack that drug-related support for terrorism and further protect america , our troops , and coalition forces on the ground in places like afghanistan .  madam speaker , i urge my colleagues to support the passage of the patriot act conference report .
