mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the usa patriot act .  nearly four years ago and shortly after terrorists maliciously killed thousands of americans on september 11 , 2001 , congress passed the patriot act .  this act provides law enforcement officials the tools they need to save lives and protect this country from future terrorist attacks .  today , we are at a critical point as congress considers extending 16 important provisions of the law .  i have looked carefully at the law and i have heavily weighed the constitutional questions some have raised .  in the end , i wholeheartedly support all 16 provisions .  i believe that the tools provided under the law are consistent with our long cherished values and consistent with our rights under the constitution .  i especially support the provisions which take important steps to ensure information sharing and cooperation among government agencies .  by providing these necessary tools , the patriot act builds a culture of prevention and makes certain that our government 's resources are dedicated to defending the safety and security of the american people .  for decades , terrorists have waged war against freedom , democracy , and u.s. interests .  now america is leading the global war against terrorism .  as president bush has said , `` free people will set the course of history .
