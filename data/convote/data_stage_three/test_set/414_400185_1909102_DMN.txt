mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 .  while congress should be revising the flawed aspects of the patriot act , we are instead poised to make permanent the provisions that were supposed to sunset at the end of this year .  my fear is that the actions of our government pursuant to the patriot act amount to nothing short of a taking , not a taking of property , rather of our rights and our liberties .  for example , the house judiciary committee democrats have uncovered the following regarding the act : it has been used more than 150 times to secretly search an individual 's home , with nearly 90 percent of those cases having had nothing to do with terrorism .  it was used against brandon mayfield , an innocent muslim american , to tap his phones , seize his property , copy his computer files , spy on his children , and take his dna , all without his knowledge .  it has been used to deny , on account of his political beliefs , the admission to the united states of a swiss citizen and prominent muslim scholar to teach at notre dame university .  it has been used to unconstitutionally coerce an internet service provider to divulge information about e-mail activity and web surfing on its system , and then to gag that provider from even disclosing the abuse to the public .  it has been used to charge , detain and prosecute a muslim student in idaho for posting internet website links to objectionable materials , even though the same links were available on the u.s. government 's web site .  these are just a few of the incidents we know of , yet they are enough to raise plenty of concerns in my mind .  because of gag restrictions , we will never know how many times it has been used to obtain reading records from libraries and bookstores , but we do know that libraries have been solicited by the department of justice -- voluntarily or under threat of the patriot act -- for reader information on more than 200 occasions since the 9/11 terrorist attacks .  rather than making the provisions in question permanent , we should be reviewing and amending the most intrusive of these provisions that are subject to the sunset clause such as : sec .  215 : secret searches of personal records , including library records .  the bill does not provide a standard of individual suspicion so that the court that examines these extraordinary requests can ensure personal privacy is respected , and also falls short by failing to correct the automatic , permanent secrecy order .  sec .  206 : `` roving '' wiretaps in national security cases without naming a suspect or telephone .  the bill does nothing to correct this overbroad provision of the patriot act that allows the government to get `` john doe '' roving wiretaps -- wiretaps that fail to specify the target or the device .  the bill also does not include any requirement that the government check to make sure its `` roving '' wiretaps are intercepting only the target 's conversations .  the patriot act originally had sunsets on some provisions so we could reexamine the extraordinary powers that were given to the executive branch , in a calmer atmosphere .  instead we are here today ignoring the more troubling provisions such as : the `` delayed notice '' of a search warrant , the intrusive `` national security letters '' power of the fbi , and the overbroad definition of domestic terrorism .  there is no more difficult task i have as a legislator than balancing the nation 's security with our civil liberties , but this task is not a zero sum game .  by passing a bill that largely ignores the most serious abuses of the patriot act , that ignores the abuse of power by the bush administration , and which fails to give adequate resources and money to those on the `` front line '' in the fight against terrorism .
