madam speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  once again , there has been erroneous information presented to the house .  the conference report on the delayed notification search warrant limits initial delayed notification to only 30 days unless the facts justify a later date .  it permits extensions of up to 90 days unless the facts justify a later date and only upon the showing of need .  and it has new reporting requirements on the use of delayed notification warrants .  now , the original patriot act did not have these time limits .  the delayed notification was determined it could be for a long period of time by a magistrate judge , a judicial officer , not by law enforcement , but by a judicial officer in determining when the notification would take place .  what i just described in the conference report is new language .  it is limitations on how long a magistrate judge , a judicial officer , can delay notification of the warrants .  you vote against this bill and you kill this bill , those limitations go down with the bill .
