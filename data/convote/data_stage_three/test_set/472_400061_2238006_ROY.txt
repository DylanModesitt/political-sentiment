mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the creation of a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina .  as representatives , we are elected by the american people , and it is our duty to ensure that the numerous federal agencies of which we have oversight and that we fund on an annual basis serve the taxpayers efficiently and effectively , and i think from the images that we have seen and from the reports from that area of the country , we have had serious problems .  this is a job best performed by the elected leaders of the united states .  we are charged with the responsibility of oversight .  we can be trusted by our constituents to find the truth .  to those who are critical of the makeup of this committee , i say to them , the united states congress has responded in similar fashion 41 times , most recently with the formation of the select committee on homeland security in 2002 and 2003 .  mr. speaker , we must form this bipartisan committee quickly so that the members from both sides of the aisle can begin the vital task of finding the problems that plagued the response to hurricane katrina on the local , state and federal levels .  if we fail to act expeditiously and devolve into finger pointing and bickering , we are putting other areas of our nation at greater risk .  mother nature will not wait for the united states congress to act .
