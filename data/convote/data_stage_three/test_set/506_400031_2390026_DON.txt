mr. chairman , i rise in support of this bipartisan substitute and in unwavering opposition to the underlying threatened and endangered species act of 2005 , which does not defend endangered species as it purports , but rather protects the special interests of private industry and landowners .  i am concerned about the environmental and fiscal health of our great nation and the path chosen by many of america 's leaders whose policies are painfully lacking in promoting conservation .  although americans may debate the need to update the endangered species act of 1973 , tesra is absolutely not the answer .  in fact , tesra is a step back , furthering the degradation of species and compounding man 's conflict with the environment .  what exactly is the urgency by which the majority has brought this issue at this time ?  america is still in mourning as we enter the early stages of rebuilding the gulf coast and fighting a war in iraq and afghanistan costing our nation hundreds upon hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars .  particularly egregious is that tesra will cost nearly $ 3 billion in new spending in just the next 4 years , which will be used not to protect threatened and endangered species , but rather the interests of private landowners .  taxpayers should be outraged by the fiscal irresponsibility of this congress .  if we have $ 3 billion to give away , let 's give it to families in need by renewing tanf or to expand rather than cut pell grants so that students who wish to attend college can meet the financial demands .  in my district , hardworking families are struggling to absorb the high costs of fuel into their budget while putting food on their tables and sending their children to college .  mr. chairman , the narrow-vision and short-term policy decisions made by this congress do not reflect middle-class values .  at what point will a clean environment and healthy future for our children and grandchildren become a priority ?  the american public deserves a future that includes true protection of our endangered species and the development of fuel sources that are clean , renewable and promote conservation and energy independence .  mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to reject the underlying legislation to reform the esa and support the bipartisan substitute .
