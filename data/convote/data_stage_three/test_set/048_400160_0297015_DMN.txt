mr. chairman , i rise today to voice my opposition to this job training improvement act because it does nothing to improve job training in our country .  congress has an opportunity to take the reauthorization of the workforce investment act and address the needs of millions of unemployed americans .  instead , we are presented with a proposal that reduces the impact of job training programs by cutting funding to traditional job training providers such as the veteran 's employment programs and perkins vocational education programs .  this bill also consolidates the adult , dislocated worker and employment service programs and their funding while repealing the wagner peyser act .  wager peyser established the federal performance and accountability standards that ensure our job training programs are quality programs that place able workers in appropriate positions in the workforce .  furthermore , this bill would allow federally funded job training organizations to question a candidate about their religious beliefs .  i 've been a christian all my life .  however , i do not feel it is the place of the federal government or anyone receiving federal funds to question a job candidate about their religious beliefs .  at this time , congress needs to place more resources into workforce training , not reduce job training programs that are successful .  the houston area continues to have an unemployment rate higher than the national average , as does the state of texas .  this bill will slow down the ability of those who need workforce training from getting it , and right now this economy needs all the help it can get .  h.r. 27 is bad public policy and will further slow our efforts to strengthen our economy .
