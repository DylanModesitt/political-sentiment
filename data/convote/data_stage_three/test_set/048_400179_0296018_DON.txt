mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , the chairman is correct .  the department already collects this data and would be able to highlight this information in its annual report to congress with very little additional work .  it is simply a matter of clearly communicating to the department that we would like to see focused information on high school-aged students in adult education reported by race , ethnicity , language proficiency , and program enrollment .  i thank the chairman for continuing to work with me and the department to bring this critical information to the forefront .
