mr. speaker , while europe and singapore and california and korea are moving forward in an effort to relieve human suffering , the united states congress , 435 theologians , have gathered here to decide a values decision .  we have no guidance .  there was no in vitro fertilization or stem cell research when jesus walked on the earth .  we are left to make the decision on our own .  the decision comes down to this : a man and woman come in to a physician .  he presents some semen .  she presents some eggs .  they put them in a jar or they put them in a petri plate , and it becomes an embryo .  they have several of them ; so they use one .  they put it in the mother .  she has a baby .  and there are a bunch left .  now what shall we do with those ?  shall we throw them down the sink , wash them away , or shall we use them to help people who have terribly debilitating diseases ?  that is what this issue is about .  like the last speaker , i am a physician .  i have counseled people who were dying with lou gehrig 's disease .  to watch somebody drown in their own secretions , someone that you know and care about , and then come in here and say we are not going to look for a way to relieve that kind of agony , we will not worry about a 13-year-old kid who gets diabetes and has to give himself thousands and thousands of shots and loses the length of life that most of us expect because of that disease ; we will say to them , well , jesus wanted us to do this .  i do not remember the lord ever saying that .  i do not ever remember his saying , i gave you a brain , you human beings .  i do not want you to figure anything out .  i do not want you to make it any better .  this is a perfectly good values judgment on which everybody should vote `` yes . ''
