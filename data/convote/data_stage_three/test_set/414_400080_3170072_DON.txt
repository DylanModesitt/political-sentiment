madam speaker , i yield myself 3 minutes .  i want to quote from a letter that was sent to chairman sensenbrenner from the american library association , its president , indeed , michael gorman , and a copy to myself .  it says : `` dear mr. chairman , i am writing on behalf of the american library association to express our opposition to the conference report .  we are deeply disappointed that the conferees did not take this opportunity to heed the concerns of library users across this country and to restore protections for records of library use that were stripped away by the patriot act '' itself .  it `` does not seriously address any of the library community 's concerns with section 215 .  it does not require a factual connection between the records sought and a terrorist or terrorist organization .  `` the report also leaves in place the usa patriot act standards for national security letters '' and would `` allow the fbi to continue its unfettered reach into the personal electronic records of the public , including records of their use of the internet through computers in libraries .  worse , it adds a criminal penalty for noncompliance with the order and for a knowing violation of the gag order .  and while adding an ability to challenge the secrecy of a national security letter on the one hand , it takes it away with the other by requiring the court to accept , as conclusive , the government 's assertion of harm to national security ... ..  `` madam speaker , this is the clearest description from the president of the american library association , supported by thousands of professional librarians from one end of the country to the other .  please , let us not buy into the fact that this is a new and improved version of the patriot act .  with the death penalties arbitrarily added , it is a definite reversal , a downward , backward movement in which the patriot act becomes meaner and less democratic and is far more dangerous for people who get caught up in these things who are innocent americans .  please join us in sending this bill back to committee and supporting my measure that would allow for a 3-month period of time for us to improve the bill .
