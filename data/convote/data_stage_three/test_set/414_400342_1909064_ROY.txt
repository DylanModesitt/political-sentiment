mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his great work on this , and i want to thank my friends on the democrat side of the aisle for the work they have given for the patriot act .  thanks for at least bringing this debate up .  mr. chairman , as a former fbi agent , i had occasion to work some pretty bad folks in the city of chicago in working organized crime and public corruption .  i developed the sources for wiretaps and applied wiretaps for things like murder and extortion , gambling , prostitution , racketeering , child pornography .  there was a case of a child pornographer who was producing child pornography tapes where we used the legal system , a legal instrument , through due process of law , to get records that we needed from businesses , from his home , from other places to make sure that we could find the entire network of distribution of criminals who were preying on our children .  america said something interesting .  the people of america said , you know , agent rogers , at the time we trust you , but we trust our constitution more , so you have to follow the law .  you have to follow the constitution even to go after these child molesters and people who are promoting child pornography , people who are involved in murder and racketeering .  and we did , and we used the law as we knew it to put somebody in jail .  we said if a child molester goes into the library and sits down next to your child , there is going to be no safe haven in america .  we are going to use due process according to the constitution and make sure our children , our libraries , our personnel are safe .  we used that before the patriot act got here .  i worked a bombing case where they were trying to sell bombs to individuals who were blowing up other gangsters ; gangsters blowing up gangsters and gangsters blowing up strip clubs and other things to gain influence over them .  we used all the processes , including a delayed search warrant , because we needed to know who they were getting their materials from .  we used due process under the constitution and we brought them to justice .  and america is grateful for that , and it made an impact .  and we never , ever , ever once deviated from the constitution .  this whole debate is almost ridiculous , mr. chairman .  all we do in the patriot act is say , look , if we can go after child molesters sitting in the library and bombers who we need to sneak and peak on a warrant , we ought to be able to go after terrorists .  that is all the patriot act did .  there is no subversion of the constitution , no suspension of the constitution .  mr. chairman , it is maddening to me that somebody in america and in england and around the world is getting up in the morning thinking , i am going to kill somebody in an act of terror , and that we somehow fiddle while rome is burning and argue should it be 10 years or 5 years on a renewal or a sunset .  this is ridiculous .  we have people who are committed to killing americans today .  we are at war .  this bill helps protect america and does not suspend the constitution of the united states .  for those who argue there are some emergency powers in here , you are wrong .  you should get up and argue against the criminal code every day on this floor , and you should put in bills to remove our ability as agents of the fbi to do that .  you do not because it is legal and it is proper under our constitution .  mr. chairman , we must support this act .  we must do it today for the future safety of the united states of america .
