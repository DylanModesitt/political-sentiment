mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  first i want to respond to a few comments made by the opposition here .  there is a lot of talk about a nonbinding resolution , but this house today is going to take up four bills to reform osha that will help small businesses and their enterprises be more competitive and their employees be more competitive in the global economy .  health care , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller )  brought up health care , and he very well knows that the committee on education and the workforce that he sits on as the ranking member is addressing health care .  we recognize that health care is a problem .  we recognize that the plight of the uninsured is a problem .  and yet i will say as a physician , as someone who has dealt with health care on a daily basis , universal government-run health care is not the answer .  we need to continue to address this problem and support solutions like association health plans , something that we have already taken up in committee and will be coming to the floor soon .  this will help get people who are uninsured back on to the rolls of being insured .  this will help small businesses provide insurance for those who lack insurance today .  we need to continue to expand health savings accounts .  these have already begun to help many americans , but we need to continue to work on this .  this is the future of health care .  this is how we are going to create a competitive health care environment that will bring down the cost and make it affordable for all americans .  and we need medical liability reform .  we need medical liability reform .  no question about it .  and this congress will address these issues .  so to say this is a nonbinding resolution , surely it makes a statement about some of the needs that we need to work on , but at the same time this congress is addressing all of those issues ; and we ask our colleagues across the aisle to join us to pass these bills so that we can help those americans in need and we can increase our competitiveness on the global market .  i support this resolution , and i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay )  and the gentleman from kansas ( mr. tiahrt )  for their tireless work to remove barriers on u.s. companies , to ensure that america can be competitive in the global economy .  american businessmen and -women are second to none in resourcefulness , entrepreneurial spirit , business ingenuity ; and the government should foster , not stifle , these qualities .  i mentioned , as a member of the committee on education and the workforce , that we are going to work on osha reform and ahps .  these are commonsense good measures that will improve our competitiveness .  frivolous lawsuits , costly health insurance , an overly complicated tax code , skyrocketing energy costs , compliance with innumerable federal and state regulations result in small businesses spending more time just trying to comply with government and government laws and regulations than growing their businesses , creating jobs , and generating revenue .  yet because of the entrepreneurial spirit of these americans and many small businesses that we have out there , they do survive and even thrive despite all these adversities .  let me talk about my district in southwest louisiana for a moment , which has been known for its entrepreneurial spirit .  today , it is a spirit that continues to grow our agricultural influence , despite many adversities , and build small businesses that are grabbing the eye of the global market .  we have a port , the 11th largest port in the country , the port of lake charles .  once known as a regional provider , it has grown into an economic engine for our state and our nation .  and as it continues to increase in size , it is moving larger numbers of products into the united states and out into the world .  our economic developers are finding ways to attract businesses that have never before known the advantages of doing business in louisiana .  let me give an example .  lafayette economic development authority is a prime example of showcasing the educational and technological benefits of louisiana 's seventh congressional district to attract companies to our area .  gregg gothreaux heads up this organization and has strived to capitalize on an outstanding workforce to make lafayette a competitive force in the business world .  in fact , in the year 2004 , inc .  magazine named lafayette , louisiana , one of the best places to do business .  and 3 months ago , entrepreneur magazine named lafayette one of the top technology centers in the south , based on its appeal and ability to attract high-tech companies .  another great example from my district is a small business with 15 employees headed up by rick broussard , and he has been able to attract the united states marine corps with a service by building these drone airplanes .  and he is hoping to build his business , employing hopefully in the near future 100 employees , so that he can improve his competitiveness and raise his revenue and contribute to the competitiveness of our country and our defense initiatives .  he is not an isolated example .  there are many examples in louisiana and around this country that are competing , despite the regulatory burden , the tax burden and other added costs of doing business .  mr. speaker , it is our job , it is our job as elected officials to ensure that our businesses have the necessary tools to compete in this global economy , and this congress will address these issues .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
