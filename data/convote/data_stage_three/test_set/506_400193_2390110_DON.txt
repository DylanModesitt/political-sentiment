mr. chairman , what possible reason is there for taxpayers to have to pay three , four times for the same protection of endangered species ?  under the bill as written , the taxpayer would have to pay a landowner once for the privileges of not building the casino .  that landowner could then sell it to his brother .  the taxpayer has to pay his brother a second time for the same project .  his brother could sell it to his cousin , and the taxpayer would have to pay a third time for the same casino .  this is a failure in drafting .  reject this bill .
