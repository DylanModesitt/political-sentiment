mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , first i would like to give my heartfelt thanks to my partner , the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle )  , our bipartisan whip team , the 201 cosponsors of this bill , and so many others who spoke today from the bottom of their hearts .  more than 100 years ago , justice oliver wendell holmes recognized that we are living in an increasingly complex world and that `` the chief worth of civilization is just that it makes the means of living more complex. '' this world , he says , `` calls for great and combined intellectual efforts instead of simple , uncoordinated ones. '' the truth of justice holmes ' words in today 's complex world is best seen in the state of scientific research .  we are on the verge of breakthroughs that will cure diseases that affect tens of millions of americans .  yet some want to turn away from this potential , to refuse to even acknowledge its existence , simply because they do not understand the complexity of this issue .  this refusal is slowing the process of ethical science and , worse , delaying advancements that could cure diseases that affect patients and families around the world .  our constituents want more from us .  they want their elected officials to thoughtfully examine tough issues like embryonic stem cell research , and create policies that address both practical and ethical challenges .  they also expect us to consider these issues not as democrats or as republicans , not as pro-life or pro-choice , but as people with family members and friends whose lives could be made better or even saved by our decisions .  passing h.r. 810 will allow the federal government to enable scientists , not politicians , to determine whether embryonic stem cell research will lead to cures for diseases that now plague us , and it will do so while establishing the clear and strict ethical guidelines that are absent today .  in 2001 , the president issued his executive order establishing the current embryonic stem cell research policy in an attempt to balance bioethics and science .  in the last 4 years , it has become clear that the policy has failed on both counts .  research has been stymied in this country , going into private hands and offshore .  research moves ahead , but not with the resources and coordination of the national institutes of health and without clear ethical standards .  i recognize that new science creates new moral dilemmas .  that is why our bill sets explicit controls on how stem cell lines can be created .  it gives another option for embryos created for in vitro fertilization , embryos created in petri dishes , that would otherwise be destroyed so that they can be used to potentially save or extend lives .  it gives the patients for whom the embryos are created the decision on how they will be used : as now , freezing for possible future use ; discarding them as medical waste or donating them to other couples for implantation ; and if this bill passes , another option , donating them for critical research that could save millions of lives of people who are already born .  here is why we need to pass this bill .  these are two young brothers from denver , colorado .  wyatt and noah forman .  both of these boys have type 1 diabetes , and both of them have been diagnosed since they were 2. a couple of months ago , little noah had convulsions in the middle of the night from low blood sugar .  his parents thought they would lose him , and now they can not sleep at night .  without a cure , wyatt and noah face possible complications ranging from a heart attack to kidney failure or even blindness as they grow up .  how can we tell these boys , these two boys and millions of others , that we would rather throw the embryonic stem cells that could provide them a cure than to allow them to be donated for science ?  how can we tell our colleagues , the gentleman from rhode island ( mr. langevin )  and the gentleman from illinois ( mr. evans )  , our mothers with alzheimer 's , our brothers with lou gehrig 's disease , the millions of americans who are praying for a cure and for whom embryonic stem cell research may hold the key , sorry , the federal government is opting out ?  let us not let 1 more year , 1 more month , or 1 more day go by without acting .  let us reclaim the federal government 's role as the leader in ethical basic research .  let us give those whom we are sworn to represent hope .  let us pass h.r. 810 .
