mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this stem cell research bill .  the science will go on with or without the united states .  diabetes , alzheimer 's , lou gehrig 's disease , these diseases will be cured either here in the united states or somewhere else in the world .  this bill is not about human cloning , which i oppose .  an embryo is special tissue .  we should not create them with the intent to terminate them later .  but here , the embryos were created with the intent to bring more children into the world .  many eggs were fertilized in this process and , once a baby is born , many fertilized eggs are left over , created with the intention to create a baby .  as oliver wendell holmes stated , even a dog can tell the difference between a stumble and a kick .  juries determine intent all the time and , here , intent is crucial .  these cells were created with the intention of creating human life , and the only alternate fate for them now is disposal .  let us not waste potential human life ; let us not waste these fertilized eggs by destroying them .  let us use them to save human lives through stem cell research .  support the castle-degette bill .
