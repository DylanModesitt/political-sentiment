mr. chairman , today i rise in opposition to h.r. 3824 .  in the 1960s , rachel carson 's book `` silent spring '' documented the harmful effects of ddt and other pesticides on songbirds .  this prompted a ban on ddt and the passage of the original endangered species act .  the ban on ddt , which the epa said posed unacceptable risks to the environment and human health , saved the bald eagle and countless other species from going extinct .  today we are considering a bill that would usher in another silent spring by eliminating the oversight for the registration of pesticides which harm wildlife and people .  h.r. 3824 contains a provision allowing epa to consult with itself in determining the potential impacts of pesticide registration on endangered wildlife and fish , instead of consulting with the fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries service , which are the expert agencies whose mission is either in whole or in part to conserve species .  h.r. 3824 would take away the ability to stop pesticide use even when necessary to prevent extinction .  without existing checks and balances on pesticide use , the effect on wildlife could be devastating .  humans could be hurt too , because toxic pesticides are applied by farm workers that make their way into our nation 's streams , rivers , and food supply .  pesticides poison 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 agricultural workers each year and are estimated to kill more than 67 million birds annually .  but the epa currently only requires balancing the profits from using a pesticide against the dollar value of harm caused by that pesticide .  the endangered species act , on the other hand , recognizes what almost all americans believe , that no dollar amount can be placed on the extension of our nation 's treasured wildlife or on the human health of people who work in those fields .  the substitute to h.r. 3824 would leave existing law unchanged .  it would leave in place current safeguards by requiring an analysis based on the health of wildlife , not the company 's bottom line .  for this reason and many others , i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this controversial bill and voting `` yes '' on the miller substitute .
