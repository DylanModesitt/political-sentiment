i thank the leader for that observation .  the happy circumstance is we both certainly agree on this procedure , that it needs to have a thorough airing and debate and discussion .  there are strong views on either side of this issue and quite obviously the consequences of this bill are very substantial .  whether it passes or whether it fails , the consequences are substantial .  so we appreciate the fact that there will be significant time to discuss and debate this issue .  mr. leader , i have two items left .  the head start reauthorization has now , as you know , been marked up by the committee .  i know it is not coming next week , and we will be out the week after that for the memorial day work period .  can you tell me when you might expect the head start reauthorization bill to come to the floor ?
