mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from the judiciary committee for the wisdom of this motion , and i applaud the joining by the chairman of the full committee and offer an explanation for the reason our colleagues should join us in supporting this motion to instruct , and frame it in the context of the crisis of the recent weeks , asking congress to accept its responsibility to investigate the cia leaks and now to investigate further the leaking of the cia sites , some call it sites of torture , incarceration , of individuals around the world who have been charged or are alleged to have committed acts of terrorism .  it is important now to speak to the american people and argue that this motion to instruct does simply one thing .  it now brings the american people into the focus of being the priority of the actions of this congress .  yes , the patriot act in some minds has offered to provide us more protection .  there were aspects of the patriot act that i did support .  the original writing was a bipartisan product .  unfortunately , the ultimate product was not as bipartisan .  but what is bipartisan is our responsibility to protect the american people .  the 4-year sunset gives us that opportunity so that we can begin in 4 years to assess whether authorizing secret intelligence , going into libraries and getting a list of your library books helps or hurts the american people ; whether the authorizing of a blank wiretap helps or hurts the american people ; whether or not the lone wolf , where you can be one individual , not part of a terrorist organization or an association or to be part of a large massive group , but one individual who may be part of , words may have suggested that they are giving some comfort to those whose views we disagree with can be hauled in as a terrorist .  this sunset allows us to protect the american people .  many of us are familiar with the recent film that said `` good night and good luck. '' it reminded us of the days of the mccarthy era when no one seemed to want to rise to support the rights of the american people .  i ask my colleagues to support this motion to instruct and sunset in 4 years so congress can have the ability to protect the rights of the american people .
