mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  may i respond simply to the arguments about our veterans because they are so important to us .  let me reiterate that h.r. 27 does not harm worker-retaining programs for veterans .  not one dollar from this account comes that is meant to help veterans with their training .  the programs that we already have in place , specifically the disabled veterans ' outreach program , the local veterans employment representative program , the vocational rehabilitation program , already are required to contribute to the infrastructure of these one-stop career center programs .  any money that would come to the one-stop center would be coming out of their administrative funds , not from the money going directly to the training of veterans .  that is an area that was specifically covered in this bill .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
