mr. speaker , there is really nothing terribly , terribly wrong with this resolution .  talking about a need to invest in greater innovation , research and education , certainly makes sense .  the vexing thing for me is this republican congress and white house has systematically unfunded almost all of those items .  we heard the numbers from my colleagues , and i will not go back over them , except to remind folks of the recent debate we had over the appropriations bills .  repeatedly , throughout the debate , as democrats talked about spending more money on a variety of different items , the republican appropriators said , you know , this is the money we have , this is the best we can do with what we have .  well , let us look at the decisions that left us in the position where `` this is what we have. '' one of the consequences of those decisions is we do not have enough money to fund the research , education and innovation that is necessary .  all of the items that are ticked off , the national science foundation , the national institutes of health , no child left behind , we all know what they are .  we know how important in the global economy innovation , research , education and skills training is .  yet the programs that fund those vital needs , vital needs particularly for blue-collar , middle-class and lower-class workers , are consistently cut , reduced , not funded like they should be because of the budget decisions of this congress .  part of it certainly is the tax cut .  that has been the decision of this congress ; supply-side tax cuts for people making a lot of money at the expense of all of these programs we are talking about today .  it is incredibly vexing to hear the republican majority stand up and talk about how much they care about these programs .  at a minimum , i wish they would make a choice , they would say : supply-side tax cuts for people making a lot of money , that is what we support ; that is what we are going to do .  that being done , we can not afford to do these other things , and that is okay .  but to stand up today and say that you care about them when you have created a budget environment where they can not be funded is disingenuous , to say the least .  if these are priorities , then let us change the budget .  and it is not just tax cuts .  we can look at the spending decisions of the last 6 years that have seen massive increases in overall federal spending while , at the same time , underfunding these critical items .  the budget priorities of the republican congress are responsible , and an empty `` sense of congress '' resolution is not going to fix that .
