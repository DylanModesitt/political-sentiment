mr. chairman , i think we are here in some sense , past all the clutter of people articulating their most emotional feelings , is a bill set aside some 30 years ago to have an understanding about how we as members of congress , the government , can restore the prodigious bounty of god 's creation .  how do we understand nature 's design ?  how do we use our intelligence to understand the facts behind how nature sustains itself ?  well , in the real world , well , actually , in the real world which is nature , but in the reality of the human condition , we have a lot of other little things that we have to take into consideration .  how do you afford an endangered species act ?  what do you do about private property rights ?  do you get enough science ?  is the recovery plan appropriate ?  do you deal with farmers that have a problem with reintroduced species on the property eating their sheep or their cows ?  all these things have to be taken into consideration so that we create a policy that protects private property rights , that brings individuals on those farms and that landscape into the process and helps pay for their contribution to the process , that brings federal agencies in so they can view the landscape , not from just one small little fly or tiger beetle or some other particular species , but upon which the landscape that supports that species , supports clean water , supports clean air , supports the whole ecosystem including human beings , including us as a species .  we are not separate from clean water .  we are not separate from clean air .  we are part of nature 's design .  we are part of this bounty of god 's creation .  so how do we clarify all these different perspectives and views based on different things that happen in our districts ?  well , we come up with the best available science .  we come up with the best available recovery plan .  we come up with the best policy for not only the species but for private property , and we come up with the funds that are appropriate to deal with all these issues .  i would tell my colleagues that i feel strongly this is the best policy change , the best reauthorization plan that we can use to deal with the endangered species act that will deal with nature 's design and man 's impact on nature 's design , which includes private property rights , which includes reimbursements for helping to preserve endangered species , and by the way , in this substitute is a provision to pay those private property individuals .  i urge an `` aye '' vote on the substitute .
