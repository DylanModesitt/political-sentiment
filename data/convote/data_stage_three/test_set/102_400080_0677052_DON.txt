mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute .  we should all be embarrassed that instead of repealing the biggest loophole in the bankruptcy code , we have had 8 years to study it , the homestead exemption , the bill places only weak obstacles in its path .  instead of protecting women and health care providers from those who would terrorize abortion clinics , we lay out a blueprint for them to avoid their debts .  instead of helping individuals who have lost their job or faced a health care emergency , we deny them the chance for a fresh start .  by passing this measure in this form , the majority is telling the american people , republicans are telling the american people , it is more important to help credit card companies than innocent spouses and children ; that it is more important to protect corporate scam artists than workers losing their pension ; that it is more important to protect unscrupulous lenders than disabled veterans .
