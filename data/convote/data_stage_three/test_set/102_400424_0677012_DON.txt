mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  mr. speaker , those of us who started this process 6 years or so ago in the good faith belief that there were problems with the bankruptcy system , in the sense that people were gaming the system , and felt that there needed to be genuine reform can not help but be disappointed today because , in the process , we have lost sight of the objective of reforming to do away with the sinister influences and the advantageous corruption that is going on in the system .  i have never seen a bill that has violated more principles throughout this process .  the first one was that the consumers and the lenders got together and decided that , because the lenders were not sure that they could do bankruptcy reform without reaching a compromise and the consumer groups realized that they might not be able to stop bankruptcy reform , they set up this system called the means test , which effectively exempted from the whole bankruptcy reform system those who fall below the means test threshold .  the result is that individuals who fall below the means test threshold can continue with impunity to game the system without any kind of responsibility , and those who fall above the threshold get subjected to a set of arbitrary rules that , even if they are not gaming the system , they are taken advantage of .  so we have lost sight of that .  the second thing is we have built in a set of perverse incentives for easy credit now .  for people who fall below the means test , there is really no disincentive for them to go out and get as much credit as they can .  and for people above the means test there is no incentive for lenders to be responsible in their lending practices , because they know now they have this system that is going to protect them from people that they have made irresponsible loans to .  the third problem is that , as we have gone through this process , the more we have bought into this means test philosophy and debated this , we now get to a point at the end of the process where it has corrupted even our democratic process .  because we are here on the floor with 30 minutes of debate on our side to tell the public the problems with this bill .  this is irresponsible legislating at its worst , and i encourage my colleagues to reject this bill and vote no .
