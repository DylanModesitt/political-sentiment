madam speaker , i wanted to mention to the gentleman that as an ob/gyn physician , of course i have had some experience with some of the processes that can occur in reproductive endocrine laboratories and the technique dealing with infertile couples , and i have had a discussion with the gentleman from maryland about this .  but in a situation where the couple is infertile and it is because of male infertility , there is nothing wrong with the egg , but there is a very , very low sperm count in the male , and normally it takes probably 1 , 000 sperm to successfully fertilize an egg in the natural way .  in fact , the normal sperm count in a male is about 60 million .  but even a sperm count as low as 1 , 000 , pregnancy can occur in the normal , natural way .  but when it gets much lower than that , it becomes less and less possible .  but they have a technique .  and there is an acronym , madam speaker .  there is an acronym for everything , it seems , even though this is not in the military .  that acronym is icsi .  it stands for intracytoplasmic sperm injection , icsi .  and these biologists working with reproductive endocrinologists , medical doctors who specialize in infertility , can literally take a single sperm and with a needle inject that sperm into the egg and create a life , and that has been done many times , and not just at the nih , but in a lot of these infertility clinics across this great country , in my state of georgia .  it is something that is done routinely .  so what the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett )  is talking about in this poster presentation in regard to waiting to just the right point for these scientists to be able to develop a technique to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying that embryo and beyond the point where that single cell itself would be an embryo , he knows of what he speaks .  and i wanted to have an opportunity to share that , madam speaker , with our colleagues and make sure they understand that here again we are not talking about star wars technology here .  we are talking about things that are being done today .
