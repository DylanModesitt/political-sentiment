mr. chairman , i reject the statement made a minute ago that this is an anti-immigration bill .  i support the sensenbrenner bill .  i think security is a national issue .  but to suggest that this is an anti-immigrant bill is , in my opinion , wrong .  we support legal immigration into this country .  it is what has made this country so great .  but we also need to take care of security .  if you want to come in on a visa , you want to come in to be a citizen , support it .  but if you are here illegally , it is wrong .  each year i have one family , just last year , the father survived .  the wife died .  he lost a child to illegal immigrants .  i wish that was the only case .  each year we have several of these .  illegal immigrants driving and causing accidents , and people say , well , they are here ; they have got to go to work .  well , they will go to work if we can get them to be legal .  but not if they are here illegally .  if they are in this country illegally , they need to go out and come back legally with a visa or proper method .  and that is why i support the sensenbrenner bill , to make sure we do not have metricula cards , we do not have driver 's licenses to illegals , and that the driver 's license has a clip to ensure that it is proper by the federal government .
