mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , first let me say that i agree with my colleague that we should be negotiating higher labor standards , at least international labor standards ; but i would suggest the way to do that is engagement , not to pull out of the wto and to do better in our bilateral agreements .  i agree with him on cafta and to elevate the wto to do better on international standards .  the withdrawal would leave these countries without any opportunity to improve labor standards .
