mr. chairman , i just wanted to commend the minority leader on the legislative history she has recounted for the benefit of us who have dealt with this across the years and add that this is a bipartisan measure .  i only wish that all of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who support this measure would also join with their voices and their votes with us on this very important day .  we can track back a record that goes back to reconstruction where we have been trying to attempt to successfully pass this measure .  so i congratulate the gentlewoman on her explanation of why we are here .
