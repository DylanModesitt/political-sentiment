i would say it would be hard to be more disappointed than i am that this committee has only met once because of continuing concerns .  from the point of view of the majority , i am sure it is our view that we removed what we thought were the obstacles of this committee moving forward with its work , only to find that there is another obstacle .  and we do need this committee to work , but all sides need to be looking for ways to make the committee work , not to just find the reasons that the committee does not work , which is my view of this .  and we clearly want this committee to work , need this committee to work , and i think the majority has made substantial efforts both publicly and privately to create an opportunity where this committee could do its job .
