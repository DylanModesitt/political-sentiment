madam speaker , i rise today in opposition to these measures .  this legislation moves in the wrong direction for worker safety .  we are spending valuable time changing small portions of osha to overturn court decisions and tweak the law to benefit industry .  i 'm not sure we should be spending time addressing all these small issues when we know that reporting requirements are a problem and we could be doing something about it .  it does n't matter in which facility these accidents occurred .  the fact is people should know if an accident has occurred and the company managing the site should report it whether contract workers were involved or not .  if someone is seriously injured at my home , regardless if i 'm at fault , there will be a report by the paramedics or the police and it will list my residence .  in march , fifteen people were killed in a refinery accident in texas city .  none of them will be on the injury site log because the law does n't require them to list contract workers .  since 1991 we 've known reporting requirements should be changed to include contract workers .  the report recommending this was sanctioned by osha under the first george bush 's administration .  there is no reason the republican leadership could n't allow at least some discussion on the reporting issue today .  people have the right to know if they are applying for a job at a facility that has a poor safety record .  we should be talking about real issues instead of making things just a little better for industry .  we 've known about this problem for 14 years .  that 's too long to avoid making a simple change to the law to require site-based reporting of injuries .
