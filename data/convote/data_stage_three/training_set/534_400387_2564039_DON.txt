mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the so-called protection of lawful commerce in arms act because i do n't believe that giving gun makers , gun dealers , and gun trade associations special exemption from lawsuits makes our streets any safer .  if this law had been in place , the families of victims of the dc-area sniper could never have held negligent suppliers accountable .  in september 2004 , eight victims received a settlement from the dealer that `` lost '' the snipers ' assault rifle from its inventory , along with at least 238 other guns .  the victims ' families also received a settlement from the manufacturer who negligently supplied the dealer despite its record of missing guns and regulatory violations .  most importantly , as part of the settlement , the manufacturer agreed to instruct its dealers of safer sales practices that should prevent other criminals from obtaining guns .  since the national rifle association owns about two-thirds of the congress , guns have fewer safety regulations than teddy bears .  the american people ca n't look to congress to protect them , so they have no choice but to turn to the courts .  it 's no surprise that this last resort will now be shut down out of deference to the almighty gun industry .  as if this blatant pandering to an industry responsible for widespread violence and mayhem is n't bad enough , this bill also violates the fundamental right of every american to have their day in court .  as soon as the president signs this bill into law , americans will be able to sue the manufacturer of any product except for guns for death , injury , and any other kind of negligence .  congress , at the behest of the nra , will close the courthouse doors to gun victims .  i vote `` no '' on this bill because no industry , certainly not the gun industry , should have the right to conduct their business without the oversight of the judicial system .
