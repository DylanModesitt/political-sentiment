mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. chairman , my friend from utah ( mr. cannon )  should be writing advertisements for the fast food industry .  throwing out red herrings , probably which would not give us obesity , about families becoming millionaires and all this stuff .  it is just a side show .  we are talking about young children .  sure , they ought to make the right choice and , sure , their parents ought to make the right choices ; but the pressure is on them through television .  parents can not always be there .  the schools are bringing in the fast food restaurants so they can make some more money and they encourage it .  and lastly and most importantly , the advertising that is aimed at these children : where is the responsibility for the adults who are running these advertisements ?  they are aimed at our children .
