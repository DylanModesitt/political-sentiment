mr. speaker , i want to put this debate in some perspective .  it was a year ago this week that the commission that the united states congress created gave their report to us , after spending approximately $ 10 million of the taxpayers ' money to put the report together , a year ago .  this debate is about how we spend another year before we do anything , and that is wrong .  what is lacking here is leadership .  the ocean issue goes back generations .  it goes back to the last administration .  president clinton had the first white house conference on the oceans out in california in 1997 .  that was where all the ideas were created that we needed to upgrade all the oceans .  president bush signed into law and appointed members of the committee which gave us this report .  what is happening is that this task force that is before the house today is just a way of delaying , stalling and not getting anything done .  everybody that is speaking here today loves the oceans .  everybody is a supporter of it , and there is not a greater supporter than mr. gilchrest .  but , unfortunately , there is a lack of leadership behind mr. gilchrest .  where , mr. speaker , is the leadership ?  there is a bill in his committee , it has been there for almost a year , and they say , we need more time .  that bill was put together with a coalition of democrats and republicans and sea grant fellows , the staff , the ph.d. 's and mas to come here and work together .  they are on it a year with members and other staff .  there has been all the work done , and it has been put in a bill .  it is a bipartisan bill .  it has all the cosponsors of the oceans caucus , three democrats and three republicans .  that bill is h.r. 2139 and the leader of that bill is mr. weldon  from the republican party .  we have not even been able to have a hearing , not even scheduled a hearing .  that bill could pass , and it is the ocean policy .  it is the sum total of the parts of those two commissions .  we do not need to spend more taxpayer money and more time in our house trying to decide what to do ; we just need to do it .  now , we created a commission after 9/11 , and after the recommendations came back , yes , there was debate on it , but in the same year we adopted it , and we took the recommendations .  this is not being done .  mr. gilchrest  is not getting the support .  what they are giving him is a bone and saying , here , go out and use the bureaucracy of the house to have another task force .  i ask , what date are we going to have a hearing for our bill ?  if we want to have some leadership on this , can you give us a date when the oceans-21 bill will be heard in your committee ?
