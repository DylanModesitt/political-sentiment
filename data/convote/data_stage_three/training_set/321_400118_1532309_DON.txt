mr. chairman , the fact that there is a funding crisis in va hospitals this year to the tune of $ 1 billion should be a surprise to no one .  on march 23 , 2004 , the legislative directors of the disabled american veterans , the paralyzed veterans of america , and the veterans of foreign wars said that passage of the budget resolution as presented would be a disservice to those men and women who serve this country and who are currently serving in iraq , afghanistan , and around the world in the fight against terrorism .  the bottom line is , this house on a partisan basis , through the budget resolution , has underfunded va medical care .  veterans groups knew it , democrats in this body knew it , democrats in the other body knew it .  in fact , i made a specific effort in the emergency appropriation bill for iraq to get additional funding for va hospitals this year , but was rebuffed by the house leadership that said that money was not necessary .  as the gentleman from wisconsin has pointed out , that money is necessary .  we have a crisis .  it is inexcusable for the leadership of the veterans administration to testify just a few months ago , 2 months ago , that they did not need any extra money to provide adequate health care for veterans .  now , just 60 days later , they admit there is a $ 1 billion crisis in funding .  we need to find out why the va misled the congress ; and , most importantly , we need to address this problem .  i would welcome a bipartisan effort in trying to address the funding needs for veterans .
