mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding .  as i said earlier , it is very difficult .  certainly we will consult with the minority as to timing .  for instance , right now we think we will have a highway conference report .  there may be an energy conference report .  there could be one to three appropriations conference reports .  it is very difficult today to fashion a schedule that we could give to the members .  i feel very confident by monday we will have a better feel for what the week should look like and , in consultation with the minority , we would have a better idea when the central american free trade agreement can be considered .  but i say to the gentleman that it will be fully discussed with an ample amount of time for debate , and we will just do it when we can get to it .
