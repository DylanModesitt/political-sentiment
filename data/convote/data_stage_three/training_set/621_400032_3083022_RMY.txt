mr. speaker , the gentleman is precisely right on that .  again , the bill tomorrow is h.r. 4297 .  it is the tax relief extension reconciliation act , and it is called the tax relief extension because these are reliefs that were passed in 2003 .  as we have continued to talk through the evening , these are the provisions that have really created this robust economy that we are seeing , 4.1 percent gdp growth just this last quarter .  i think it is so important that we keep our focus there .  this is a booming economy .  this is a growing economy .  we are seeing regularly that there is jobs creation that is taking place in our communities .  i love it when i am out in my community , and i know the gentleman from texas has the same experience , and you are driving down the street and all of a sudden you see an entire group of new stores that are going in .  generally they are small businesses .  you walk inside and there is an excitement and energy there that is just indescribable .  there is so much of that happening in this nation 's small businesses .  as people have seen their rate of taxation reduced , they have had a little bit more income left with those businesses that they can go back in and reinvest in those businesses , or gather that capital together to start that business or start that small manufacturing plant .  that is why we see the business reinvestment dollars up 10 percent .  that is why we see jobs creation taking place , why we are seeing over 4 million jobs , 4.46 million jobs created since we started down this path of reforming taxes , reducing those taxes and freeing up free enterprise .
