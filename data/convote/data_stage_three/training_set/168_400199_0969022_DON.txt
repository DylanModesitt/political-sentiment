madam chairman , let me add to the distinguished gentleman 's commentary .  first of all , in the passage of the patriot act , if we are fearful of these gangs smuggling individuals over who do terrorist acts , the patriot act enhances sentencing on those engaging in terrorist acts .  that tragic incident in texas , for example , in houston , the information suggests that the dad was involved in gang activity that caused the , if you will , rising of the level of violence ; but the good news is that the sheriff 's department arrested those violent criminals .  this bill misses the point by providing a comprehensive approach to have intervention to be able to dissuade some of the young people of america away from the affinity and kinship of gangs .  that is why the bill is wrong , and this is why it does not have a full comprehensive approach .
