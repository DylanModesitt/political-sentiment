mr. chairman , this is a vital bill for the future of our country , and this bill provides a very balanced approach to research in the scientific areas and to energy development and , indeed , renewable energy as well as vital water projects and infrastructure for this country to keep us economically sound .  i would particularly like to commend the chairman and the staff in working with both sides here on this bill .  it could do more if the resources were available ; but given that they are not , we are making the best , i think , of what we have .  i would like to single out the energy supply and conservation account which funds renewable energy , energy efficiency , nuclear energy , nondefense environment , safety and health programs and energy conservation .  these are funded at $ 1.7 billion .  over $ 360 million is provided for hydrogen and fuel cell research .  this funding supports and expands the president 's hydrogen initiative and promotes the freedom car project .  hydrogen is the fuel source of the future and funding in this bill moves us closer to that goal .  thirdly , the committee recommends $ 3.6 billion for the office of science , an increase of $ 203 million over the budget request .  additional funds are provided for priority work on advanced scientific computing , high energy physics and operation of user facilities .  lastly , office of science funding provides for the basic building blocks of science and is the gateway to future scientific breakthroughs .  we must keep america 's scientific knowledge strong and on the cutting edge .  advanced scientific computing allows the u.s. to keep up with the rest of the world .  we can not allow other countries to surpass the u.s. 's knowledge .  i commend the chairman and i urge the passage of the bill .
