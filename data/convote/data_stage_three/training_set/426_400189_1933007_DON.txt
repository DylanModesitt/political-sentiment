mr. speaker , i thank the leader for that response .  i understand the problem of pinning down now exact times .  would it be fair , however , mr. leader , to say that it would not be considered on the last day we are here , on friday , or not , so that we could make sure that members knew and had some degree of confidence , because it is such an important piece of legislation , that it would not be considered on the last day we are here ?
