mr. chairman , i wish the gentleman would have discussed that with me at the time .  we had a similar problem at loma linda veterans medical center , the sister hospital of the jerry pettis veterans hospital , and we found a way to do seismic retrofitting by way of using a laser .  no portion of the hospital needs to be closed down while the work is being done .  thereby , patients can actually be in the hospital while the work is being done .  we did not have that discussion .  mr. chairman , has the gentleman visited that hospital in the last years ?
