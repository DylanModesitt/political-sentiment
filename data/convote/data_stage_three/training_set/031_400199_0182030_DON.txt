mr. chairman , reclaiming my time and i would simply say the comment on this is that i appreciate the distinguished gentleman from delaware being open with his response .  one of the concerns i have is that we do not know whether dhs is doing this or what tsa is doing and hearings would have been appropriate .  this is a valid issue , let us not doubt that ; and , of course , i would hope that we would want a database to be secured .  i do have to raise red flags on making sure it is not random , making sure there is a conviction , and in knowing what happens with dhs .  i would have wanted to have hearings , but i thank the gentleman for his answers .
