i know the gentleman says he is older than me and i question that .  i know i have been here longer than he .  i remember when i first came down in 1988 , there were a group of republicans who would come down and do special orders every night , and they had the pages come out with this digital clock that really was the length of this dais here , and every night they would talk about the deficit and how they wanted to cut the deficit and the deficit was climbing too high .  that is just all completely out of the window .  all they have done now is increase the deficit .  i have statistics here that this budget resolution which they were going to vote on last week and now they so far can not get the votes for it , and hopefully they will never get the votes for it that they were talking about , will increase the deficit by more than $ 100 billion over 5 years .  by contrast , the house democratic budget achieved balance in 2012 .
