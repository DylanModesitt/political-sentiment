mr. speaker , it seems that the charts that my colleague showed listing all the lawsuits actually make the case for how the system is working because , as he knows , many of those cases have been dismissed by the court .  the court looked at them ; and those cases that were frivolous , it decided to dismiss .  so why are we trying to change the rules ?  it is because there are some cases that have merit , like the sniper cases and others , that would continue to go through , and under this legislation , they will not .  why change the rules to deny legitimate victims their day in court ?
