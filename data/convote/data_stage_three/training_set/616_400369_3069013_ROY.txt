mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , the gentleman from california ( mr. stark )  mentioned that we were trying to reward our friends in some way .  and we hear from the gentleman who just left the well about cafta and going back and rehashing cafta , talking about votes in the middle of the night .  i would like to pose this question : what is wrong with trying to reward our friends ?  that is who we want to promote business with is our friends .  there is nothing in the world wrong with that and we should do that .  i would also like to point out when he was talking about votes in the middle of the night , it is now 3 : 40 eastern standard time , the sun is shining brightly , and it is a beautiful day .
