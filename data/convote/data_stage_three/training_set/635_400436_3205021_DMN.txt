madam speaker , american workers know that a defined pension plan is a promise from their employer , a promise that , when they retire , they will receive a benefit they can rely on .  in fact , they have planned their retirement future on that promise .  this bill allows companies to break that promise .  it allows companies to switch midstream to cash balance plans , ignoring that promise to their workers .  these workers have trusted that this benefit will be there .  it will be there at the end of their service to a company .  in fact , these workers have quite often given up pay raises or other benefits for their retirement security .  these pension benefits have been earned .  they have been promised .  they must be honored .  actually , earlier this year , the republican majority tried but failed to destroy the social security system by going back on their promise to every american that at a certain age they would receive a defined benefit , a benefit they could count on .  americans overwhelmingly stood up to the republicans and said social security is ours , you promised it , we rely on it , you can not have it .  so the republican majority could not take social security away from americans with privatization .  now , they are trying to pull the rug out from under people who have dedicated their lives working hard for their companies .  madam speaker , these workers were promised defined retirement benefits .  they earned those benefits , and this congress can not allow companies to go back on their word .  we must ensure that these hardworking americans get the pension benefits they have been promised that they have earned .  i urge my colleagues to oppose h.r. 2830 .  protect american pensions .
