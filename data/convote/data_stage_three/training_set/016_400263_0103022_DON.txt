mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume in closing .  this congress should be leading the way to end discrimination of any form in this country .  unfortunately , we have a resolution before us today that condones discrimination .  i think it is sad we are dealing with this today .  i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the resolution .
