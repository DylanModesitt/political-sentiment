mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for the distinguished way in which he has conducted the debate and also the gentleman from alabama ( mr. rogers )  for sponsoring this resolution .  mr. speaker , let us make this clear .  this is not about some social issue .  the real impetus for this barring of the american military from our college campuses is because of the left-wing core of administrators and professors who do not like this country .  and we could substitute another protest issue for them in this thing and it would not make a bit of difference .  these are the same people who in many cases had protests in favor of the viet cong during the vietnam war .  many of them protested our involvement in el salvador , protested our bringing democracy to nicaragua , protested our participation in the first desert storm in the early 1990s , and in this recent bringing of freedom to iraq .  they protested all those things .  they hate all things military .  and the interesting aspect of this debate is that these same left-wing professors and administrators profess to let young people make up their own minds .  free thinking is theoretically their trademark .  let us have some free thinking .  let us allow the military to be on the campuses .  let us allow the students to have access to their information , and let us let them make up their own minds .  there is no draft here .  this is a volunteer military .  they do not have to join the military .  but the idea that the left-wing professors and administrators have to protect the students from that very military that the gentleman from florida ( mr. miller )  so eloquently described as the protectors of all of our freedoms including their freedoms to have academic freedoms , to protest and to speak freely , the idea that these students have to be shielded from the guarantors of our freedoms is nonsense .
