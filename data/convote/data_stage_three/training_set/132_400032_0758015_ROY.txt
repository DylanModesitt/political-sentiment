madam speaker , i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. gohmert )  for participating with us tonight .  he is exactly right .  the estimate is that 500 , 000 new jobs will be created over the next year by the changes made in the energy policy for this nation .  as i close this time that i have had tonight , i do want to certainly draw some attention to provisions of the bill , and tomorrow we hope that everyone is going to be able to talk with us and work with us as we go through the bill .  and we are going to address so many things not only with our small business , but we are going to hear about electricity transmission and capability and reliability of our nation 's electricity and the electrical sources .  everyone was concerned , and we all are , when we hear of brownouts and blackouts and the series of blackouts over the past decade .  so electricity is something that we will be addressing .
