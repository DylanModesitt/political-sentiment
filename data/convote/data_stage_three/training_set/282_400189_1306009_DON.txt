mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for that information .  i note , mr. whip , that the intelligence authorization bill , which was schedule to be on the floor today , which had been pulled , is not on the schedule for next week .  that obviously is a very important bill .  and it is , i would say to my friend , as i understand it , a bill which has the agreement between the chairman of the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat on the intelligence committee .  so it would seem to be a bipartisan agreement on the substance of the bill .  can the whip tell us when we might see that bill back ?  i am sure you agree it is a very important bill , providing for the work of the national intelligence director and providing to make sure that we can keep this country safe from terrorists , and i know that both sides are hopeful that it will come forward pretty quickly .  can the gentleman tell us when that might be on the floor ?
