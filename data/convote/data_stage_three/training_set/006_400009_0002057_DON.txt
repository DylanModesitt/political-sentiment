mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the rules package that we have before us today .  it is outrageous that my republican colleagues have placed before us a rules package that at best lacks integrity , and at worst is completely unethical .  as the highest body of elected officials in our country , we should be held to the highest ethical standards .  but instead , my republican colleagues have opted to put before us a rules package that actually lowers our ethics standards , so that they may promote their own agenda , at whatever cost .  this rules package makes it far more difficult for ethics investigations to take place .  by requiring a majority of the ethics committee before an investigation can even begin , we are in great danger of diminishing the integrity of our great institution .  with this new rule , the majority party can effectively block any ethics investigation of a member of their party .  this is an abuse of power .  and it 's not just democrats who oppose this plan .  americans across the country have expressed their opposition to this plan .  my democratic colleagues and i have a better plan that will strengthen the ethics rules to improve congressional accountability and to make sure that legislation is properly considered .  the republican plan fails to close a loophole that allows legislation to be considered before members have read it .  last year this led to the passage of a provision that would have let the federal government deeply invade citizens ' privacy by reading their tax returns .  i am appalled that the republicans have failed to include the democratic provision to tighten this loophole .  mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the resolution , so that we do not allow this rules package to become law .
