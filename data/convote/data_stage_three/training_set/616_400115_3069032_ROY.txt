mr. speaker , i thank my friend for that contribution , showing , as i said , that the standard of living in the united states of america is strong .  and the president has put it very well : we are never going to be satisfied until every american who wants a job has a job .  we must continue to do everything possible to ensure that that happens , and that again is what this agreement is about .  ninety-four percent of the world 's consumers are outside of our borders , mr. speaker .  so i believe we must do everything we can to pry open those markets , because the world has access to the u.s. consumer market , and that is a good thing ; but what we need to do is gain more and more access to their markets .  so this is a win-win all the way down the line .  this is a continuation of what we have seen of the drcafta agreement , the nafta agreement , and others that are creating great opportunity for u.s. workers and consumers alike .  and i want to say in conclusion that i am very , very grateful that through this agreement we are getting us back to this notion of bipartisanship , because it is not a republican or democratic issue .  trade is an issue that should see the support of republicans and democrats .  we are happy to provide the lead , but every democrat who wants to jump on board in support of the cause of free trade is more than welcome , and i am happy the democrats are understanding the critical importance of this effort .
