i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his great work on this bill .  mr. chairman , this country needs to create a new energy landscape that begins shrinking our disproportionate reliance on foreign energy sources and begins building one that places american ingenuity , producers and consumers at the forefront .  i want to highlight one provision and that is the provision that significantly strengthens the important leaking underground storage tank program .  the bill increases state funding from the lust trust fund for states containing a larger number of tanks or whose leaking tanks present a greater threat to groundwater , it requires onsite inspections of underground storage tanks every 3 years , it institutes operator training requirements for tank owners and operators , and the legislation allows states to stop deliveries of fuel to noncompliant regulated tanks in order to achieve legal enforcement .  these are all strong recommendations not only made by the general accounting office , but they have also been previously passed by the house .  they are proenvironment , antipolluter provisions .  i urge their support and the support of the bill .
