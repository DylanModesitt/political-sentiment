mr. chairman , absolutely .  let me point out that the gentleman from kansas is not only working hard on this particular issue , but he is a key player on agricultural issues that we deal with on a daily basis here in washington .  i am not only on this issue , but whatever issue the gentleman brings forward , we are ready and willing to discuss , work with and solve problems with him .  he comes to the table every day very serious about these issues and truly in his heart wants to solve issues that face agriculture across the country .
