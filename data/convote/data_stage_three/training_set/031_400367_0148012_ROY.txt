mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , we have had an opportunity to hear from the gentlewoman from texas about a document that is old , that contained the best estimate and work at the time from the congressional budget office .  i have made available to the gentlewoman from texas and for each and every member of this body to see that the congressional budget office has very clearly talked about the costs that would be associated with what might be known as an unfunded mandate .  we believe , and they have concurred from the congressional budget office that we are well within budgetary amounts to where we would not trigger this unfunded mandate clause .  i think it is important that we do have this law .  i am glad we have debates over how much burden we are placing upon states or municipalities , but in this case , i would urge my colleagues to understand that we have the official document that is as of yesterday by the congressional budget office ; and i would ask that they would support our position , knowing that we have fallen within the rules of the house .  mr. speaker , as a result of this , i would simply say that our position is , we value and hold and believe we are well within the rules of the house of representatives .
