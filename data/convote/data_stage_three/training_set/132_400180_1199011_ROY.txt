mr. chairman , i share the gentleman 's support of this important program , and i share his goal in this field .  i am disappointed that the department 's fiscal year 2006 budget request did not preserve the increases that this subcommittee provided for this purpose during the past 2 fiscal years .  because of the department 's disregard for congressional intent , the committee provides $ 30 million of the increase for the center of competition science at oak ridge national laboratory which was selected competitively to build this leadership-class supercomputer .  the committee expects the department to make full use of this laboratory industry capability .  finally , i agree with the gentleman of the importance of this effort and encourage the department of energy to make the necessary budget requests in the future to continue this very important effort .
