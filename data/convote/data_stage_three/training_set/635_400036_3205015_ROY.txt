madam speaker , reclaiming my time , as has been the case all year , the lines of communication between those of us that are interested in this , both on and off the committee , and those on the other side of the aisle as well , the lines of communication are open and will remain open .  as we move into conference , the process , i remain committed to ensuring that the concerns of all stakeholders involved are addressed in a bipartisan fashion as we complete action on comprehensive reforms in an expeditious manner .  i remain committed , as i believe both of my colleagues do , that airlines do , and that we need to find a solution that will allow airlines to maintain their plans and ensure employees of both plans are adequately funded .  madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
