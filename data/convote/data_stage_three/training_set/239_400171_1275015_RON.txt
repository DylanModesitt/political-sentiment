mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of the time .  mr. speaker , american workers produce goods that are second to none .  however , our success in selling these goods in a global marketplace , and we have to admit that we are in a global market , is dependent on fair and open markets .  the world trade organization continues to advance and create more fair and open markets .  while i oppose the underlying bill , members of the congress should have the opportunity today to examine the merits of the united states ' participation in the wto .  the debate on house resolution 27 is an important one , and one that should be had .  so i urge my colleagues to support the rule , house resolution 304 , and to oppose the underlying bill .  mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution .  the previous question was ordered .  the resolution was agreed to .  a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .
