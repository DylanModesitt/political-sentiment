mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  let me take the time i have remaining to just say that we are not doing what the 9/11 commission asked .  they wanted us to negotiate with our states on whether they wanted to do this or not ; and what we have done is impose upon the states , without any hearings or any discussion with them , from top down , an unfunded mandate requiring them to change their driver 's license at our whim .  so this is not that at all .  we are , in fact , undoing what the 9/11 commission said .
