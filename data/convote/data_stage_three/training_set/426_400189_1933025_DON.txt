mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i presume , am i correct , that the gentleman 's effort would be to try to pass it prior to the expiration of the last temporary extension , or would the gentleman anticipate another , which i guess would be the tenth or the eleventh extension ; or does the gentleman think he can perhaps get it through prior to wednesday night ?
