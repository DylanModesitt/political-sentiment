mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word .  mr. chairman , as the gentleman from ohio ( mr. regula )  said , there are no plans for anyone in the federal government to conduct universal screening , and there are no funds in this bill for any such purpose .  having said that , let me simply say i do not think our problem in this country is that we do too much screening for mental health problems with young people .  we are all familiar with the problem of youth depression .  there are a very significant number of teenagers who are afflicted with that problem .  we are , i think , all familiar with the sad situation with regard to teenage suicide .  two friends of each of my sons committed suicide .  so i do not think the problem in this country is that we know too much about mental health problems for young people .  the problem is just the opposite ; we know too little .  so i agree with the concerns expressed by the gentleman from ohio ( mr. regula )  .
