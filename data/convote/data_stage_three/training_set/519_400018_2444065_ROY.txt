mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i support increased liheap funding and the energy policy act of 2005 the for liheap funding from $ 2 billion to $ 5.1 billion .  i will work with the gentleman to help increase the amount of funds appropriated for liheap , to help those americans , including those americans in your great state of new york , most vulnerable to the higher energy costs we are seeing today .  mr. speaker , i oppose the motion to recommit .  i know we are tired and grumpy , and we want to go home and catch planes .  let me simply say that it appears to be the stupak language on price gouging that was in the democratic substitute .  if that is correct , we have already had the vote , and we have in the pending bill language that addresses price gouging .  so i guess we just have a difference of opinion .  it reminds me of what ginger rogers said when she was asked to comment on what a great dancer fred astaire was .  she said , `` yes , but i do it , and i do it in high heels backwards. '' so we both agree on both sides of the aisle that we need to do something about price gouging .  i would say the base bill before us does it a little bit more eloquently , and it does it so that we can actually get to the root cause without preempting the states .  mr. speaker , i urge a `` no '' vote on the motion to recommit .
