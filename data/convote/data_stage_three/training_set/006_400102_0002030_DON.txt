mr. speaker , we are making a terrible mistake here today by changing the rule in terms of the provision that would simply require no action after a 45-day period because , as the earlier speaker immediately preceding me indicated , what we will have done is change a nonpartisan committee that is based on a nonpartisan process into one that provides for a partisan veto over action where the behavior of an individual member or members is at question .  that , i suggest and submit , is something that this institution will suffer from .  there has been much discussion recently regarding this package .  it was anticipated that there would be additional provisions that were not submitted today , but let us be clear what is at risk here .  it is the confidence of the american people in the integrity of this institution .  perception , as we all know , is reality .  and when the american people understand very clearly that we now have a committee on standards of official conduct in which either side has a veto , it will undermine the confidence of the people in our ethical process .  my question to the proponents would be , what is wrong with the current rules ?  we have operated on them .
