mr. speaker , how about this for short-sightedness .  we are going to cut the centers for disease control .  everybody is talking about the avian flu .  we do not know what to do .  people are making requests of the administration .  i am sorry , but government is the problem , unless somebody needs something .  and i am sorry , but the republican majority has had this house since 1994 .  they have had the senate since 2000 or 2001 , definitely since 2002 , and on and off through the 1990s , and the white house since 2001 .  they can not govern .
