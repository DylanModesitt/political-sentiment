mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  if i might take just a brief moment in introducing my first speaker , i would like to just say on behalf of our side in particular but i think on behalf of the entire congress , we always respect members who go on to bigger and better things and today the president made a wise announcement in nominating the gentleman from ohio ( mr. portman )  to become our u.s. trade representative .  the applause meter made it look pretty good for confirmation there , i say to my very good friend , and he is my friend .  he has been the vice chairman of the committee on the budget , and he has been a great wing man and personal friend to so many .
