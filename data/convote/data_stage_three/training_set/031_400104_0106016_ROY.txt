i appreciate the gentleman yielding to me , mr. speaker .  we have not discussed any rule .  actually , we are discussing with the relevant committee chairmen whether we can get it that quickly or not .  but i would imagine that the committee on rules would have the same sort of rule that we have had on this bill for the last couple of years .  so i would not see anything changing .
