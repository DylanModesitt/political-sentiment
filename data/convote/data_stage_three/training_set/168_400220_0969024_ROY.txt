madam chairman , i thank the esteemed chairman for yielding time to me , and madam chairman , i ask for this opportunity to say a few words in support of the bill that is before us and in compliments to the work done by the gentleman from virginia who has announced to us that there is a number , the best estimate at 750 , 000 to 850 , 000 , gang members in the united states .  when we think about the magnitude of that size number , 750 , 000 to 850 , 000 , 75 to 100 percent , and a lot believe the number is very close to 100 percent , are illegal immigrants who have established a gang culture in the ethnic enclave that is a necessary result of illegal immigration .  this ethnic enclave has created and fostered some of the worst gains we have ever seen in this country , people that cut off hands and arms and heads , people that have a network across this nation that from a prison in california can order an execution on the streets of virginia or from a prison in virginia , order an execution in a prison in l.a .  or on the streets of l.a .  that is what this culture has fostered ; and that amount , that 850 , 000 , that is roughly out of the 10 million illegal immigrants , that is about 8 1/2 percent of the illegal population ends up in a gang .  one in 12 people that come across the border illegally and stay here end up in a gang .  by these numbers , it is an astonishing thing ; and if we have 1.1 million that come across the southern border , these are the ones that stay here , calculate the numbers that turn out into gangs , the price to this society in hands and arms and heads .  madam chairman , i thank my colleague for this privilege to speak before this house .
