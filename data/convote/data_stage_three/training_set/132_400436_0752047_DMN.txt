mr. chairman , the chairman of the committee on science knows what is right .  the energy bill before us today is bad for the consumer , bad for the environment , and it does not make us energy independent .  in fact , it is the ultimate reason we are insecure as a nation .  in fact , by promoting the interests of corporations over consumers and pollution over conservation , this bill makes the united states much less secure .  h.r. 6 will harm more than just our environment , however .  america 's continued reliance on middle east oil for the majority of our energy needs is the single largest factor that contributes to our lack of national security .  it is time we stopped all efforts to drill in anwr because this is only a stop-gap measure .  instead , we need real energy independence , and that will only come when we start focusing our efforts as a nation on clean , renewable sources of energy , conservation , and efficiency .  it would be hypocritical for anyone who cares about our nation 's well-being to vote for this legislation .  i urge my colleagues , join me , vote against it .
