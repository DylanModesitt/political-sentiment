mr. chairman , let me just speak for a minute or two .  i thought there were going to be some other members that wanted to speak in favor of the resolution ; but until they arrive , let me just talk for a minute or two about some of the costs .  the brac commission estimated that $ 35 billion would be saved over a 20-year period , but the $ 35 billion figure includes assumed cost savings due to military personnel actions .  both the brac commission and the gao believe the military personnel savings should be excluded from the overall savings figure .  once those personnel savings are removed , the overall savings fall to approximately $ 15 billion over 20 years .  there is a one-time up-front cost of $ 21 billion to implement the brac round , and the dod claimed that the savings from military personnel are not savings at all .  these costs do not disappear ; they simply shift from one base to another , and those folks are still in the military , and we still have to pay for them .  for some air force recommendations , the military personnel cost savings represents 90 percent of the total savings .  and in the case of the air national guard end strength , it remained mostly the same .  obviously , no savings come from simply moving positions around the country .  if we keep the same number of personnel , dod spending levels will not actually be reduced .  the brac commission concludes that dod savings estimates were vastly overstated and overestimated .  and there is also a quote from the commission on page 330 of their report : `` in fact , the commission is concerned that there is a likelihood that the 2005 brac round could produce only marginal net savings over the 20-year period. '' mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
