mr. speaker , this motion is offered by a member who stated to the speaker that he is opposed to this bill .  he is opposed to providing additional security to judges , to prosecutors , to witnesses , to victims and their family members .  he is opposed to a bill that has been worked on significantly on a bipartisan basis .  and he has stated that he is opposed to doing something where there is a crying need , given the threats and the murders in courthouses all around the country , and not just federal courthouses but state and local courthouses as well .  now , what does he propose to do in the motion to recommit ?  he proposes to add additional criminal penalties for things that are already criminal .  and all that does is to confuse juries , to confuse prosecutors , to confuse people who are attempting to do business with the government .  profiteering in an illegal manner is already criminal under the united states code .  we do not need to confuse the issue with an additional statutes .  and we do not need to defeat this bill by this motion that has been offered by several proclaimed opponents of this bill .  the bill is a good one .  in order to get it passed and signed into law to protect the judicial branch and those who do business and work for it , vote this silly motion down and pass the bill as has been worked out on a bipartisan basis .
