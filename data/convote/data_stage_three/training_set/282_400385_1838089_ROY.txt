mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. chairman , i want to again thank the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde )  for his steadfast leadership against drug traffickers around the world , as well as the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith )  .  they have been yeomen in the fight against narcotics , human trafficking , terrorism , and in defense of international human rights .  i urge unanimous consent , if not an overwhelming majority , asking that these drug traffickers be extradited and we get adequate information from the state department so we know what we are requesting because we have not been able to get that data .
