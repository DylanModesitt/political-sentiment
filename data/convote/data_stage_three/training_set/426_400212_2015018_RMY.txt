mr. speaker , i support the rule , and i support h.r. 525 .  the number one problem facing small businesses today is the skyrocketing cost of health insurance .  association health plans are a big part of the solution .  i met with many small business people in my hometown of orlando , florida , and they told me they need association health plans .  i agree with them , and here is why : of the 45 million americans without health insurance , 60 percent are small business employees and their families .  they do not have health insurance because their small business employers can not afford it .  if we would allow these small businesses to join together , they could have the same bargaining power as large fortune 500 corporations , which could lower their health insurance premiums by up to 30 percent .  association health plans will increase access to health care for millions of americans now without insurance .  it certainly is an issue that is personal to me .  i had the happy privilege of flying down to orlando , florida , with president bush on air force one on march 18 of this year .  he asked me what , if anything , he could do to help small businesses in my area .  i told him what the small businesses told me : the number one thing they want is association health plans , and he pledged to support it and use his bully pulpit to help it get through the senate .  i also authored a small business bill of rights that passed this house back in april .  it called for the passage of association health plans , fixing the death tax , and cracking down on frivolous lawsuits .  this house is on record as supporting that .  it is time for us to take the lead today and help small business people provide health insurance to their employees .  vote `` yes '' on the rule and vote `` yes '' on h.r. 525 .  i urge my colleagues to do these things .
