mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , it is clear that today 's legislation is not the answer .  certainly it is not about addressing the larger issue , obesity , and its impact on the american health care system .  this legislation demonstrates the blind eye the majority leadership is turning to the very real challenges americans are facing today .  regardless of what happens with this legislation today , america 's health care system will still be in dire need of responsible leadership .  the american people deserve an honest discussion .
