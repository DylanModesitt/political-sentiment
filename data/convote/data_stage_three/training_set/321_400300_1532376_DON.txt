mr. speaker , this is a simple , straight motion to recommit so that the committee can repair the shortcomings in the education , health care and worker protection programs in the bill , and so that the committee can respond to the announcement of the veterans administration yesterday by adding a billion dollars to veterans health care programs .  i urge an `` aye '' vote on the motion to recommit .  i will be voting against final passage , and i would hope a good many others will , too .
