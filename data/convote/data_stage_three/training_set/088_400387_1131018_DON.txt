madam chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 2361 .  this legislation is irresponsible .  it under-funds programs to preserve open space .  it endangers public health .  and , it abdicates our responsibility to protect the environment for future generations .  in this time of increased growth and urban sprawl , our green spaces are more precious then ever .  instead , this bill eliminates funding for the land and water conservation fund , designed to help local communities preserve open space , protect wildlife and make recreation opportunities available in urban areas .  in addition , this bill cuts funding for the environmental enforcement activities of the epa by $ 12 million .  republicans have consistently sought to weaken environmental standards and this maneuver is the latest in a series of attempts to undermine what have been successful environmental protections and the behest of big business .  big business should never be allowed a free pass to destroy the environment while endangering the health of millions of americans who will be exposed to dirtier air and water .  i wo n't vote for this indefensible legislation that only serves to harm the environment and put americans ' health at risk .  we have a responsibility to protect our citizens and our environment and this legislation blatantly takes us in the opposite direction .  i urge my colleagues to vote `` no . ''
