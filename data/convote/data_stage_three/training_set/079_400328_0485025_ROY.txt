mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  there will be that opportunity , this being the rule on the budget ; but i will engage in a bit of discussion about the social security because i am one who will gain or lose a great deal , being someone who will reach that retirement age at that year of insolvency .  and it is shocking to me that the party who gave us social security , and should be very proud of it and are , are almost in complete denial about the looming crisis that it faces and refuse to accept the fact that , regardless of which option we choose to solve the problem , that it is something that should be kicked down the road to future generations , to future congresses , to future years .  and there is a stone wall of resistance to any discussion at all about for once congress getting ahead of a big issue , for once congress actually dealing with the problem before it is crashing down around our heads , for once congress actually being bold and looking into the future beyond the next budget cycle , beyond the next election , beyond the next short-term problem and actually tackling it and dealing with it .  anyone who has been through their freshman orientation upon being elected has a bipartisan group give them the long-term unfunded liabilities of this government , and we acknowledge that there are vast differences in the approach to saving social security .  but , unfortunately , largely with one bold , brave exception in the gentleman from florida ( mr. boyd )  , there has been total resistance to have any constructive effort to bring about a solution to this problem .
