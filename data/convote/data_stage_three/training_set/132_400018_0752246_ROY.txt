in the beginning , he has some efficiency standards .  he goes through and sets some specific standards on specific appliances , dishwashers and things like this .  but on page 21 , there is something beginning on line 16 that i just do not understand and i just want to see .  the gentleman from new york may not understand it either , because he may not have had much advance work in drafting this .  the heading is administration , penalties , enforcement and preemption .  it says , `` section 345 of the energy policy and conservation act , 42 u.s. code 6316 , is amended by adding at the end the following. '' it just goes down and says if a state wants to set up a specific standard , that is fine , and that state standard will not be preempted until the federal standards established under this bill take effect on january 1 , 2010 .  i understand that .  he is saying the states can set a standard , but once the standards in the bill kick in on january 1 , 2010 , the federal standard preempts .  that is a policy debate ; we can argue that back and forth .  the next section , i do not understand , subparagraph 3 , line 16 : `` if the california energy commission adopts , not later than march 31 , 2005 , a regulation concerning the energy efficiency or energy effective after , the standards established under section 342 ( a ) ( 9 ) take effect on january 1 , 2010. '' what does that mean ?  while the gentleman is trying to get me an answer , this is the kind of thing that if we had this in regular order in a markup , there would be counsel at the desk and members of the committee of jurisdiction would ask the counsel to explain it ; and if it is a drafting error , then that could be corrected .  if it is not a drafting error , then at least the members know .  i am assuming that is a drafting error , but it may not be .
