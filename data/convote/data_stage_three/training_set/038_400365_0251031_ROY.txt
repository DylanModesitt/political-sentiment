mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , once again , critics of the legislation have it backwards .  this legislation will streamline jurisdictional inquiries by putting an end to all of the gaming that takes place under the current system , and the so-called delay refers to procedural rules that already exist under the current system .  under existing law , diversity of citizenship between the parties must exist , both at the time a complaint is filed and at the time a complaint is removed to federal court .  however , if the plaintiff files an amended complaint in state court that creates jurisdiction , or if subsequent events create jurisdiction , the defendant can then remove the case to federal court .  current law is also clear that once a complaint is properly removed to federal court , the federal court 's jurisdiction can not be ousted by later events .  thus , for example , changes in the amount of controversy after the complaint has been removed would not subject a lawsuit to be remanded to state court .
