mr. chairman , i am concerned this bill will not clear the budget responsibility .  h.r. 6 technically does not violate the budget act because it is an unreported bill , and budget act points of order generally only apply to reported bills .  the bill generally is inconsistent with the 302 ( a ) allocations for both the 2005 and house-passed 2006 budget resolutions .  section 2053 of the bill does , however , create a new entitlement program outside the budget window ( specifically , fy 2016 ) .  it uses a portion of outer-continental receipts to fund new mandatory state-run conservation , education , and infrastructure programs .  estimates indicate that the annual cost of this provision could be in the range of $ 1.75 billion .  if h.r. 6 were a reported bill , such a provision might subject the bill to a section 303 point of order .  we just passed a budget only after clarifying a point of order would defeat any appropriations bill over budget .  it appears that we have to expand this point to protect against bills like this .
