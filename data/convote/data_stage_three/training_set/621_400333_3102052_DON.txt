mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , i would just like to say briefly , if the chairman of the ways and means committee is saying that the alternative minimum tax is in the other body 's bill , then he must be saying that the tax cuts that we are talking about today are not in the other body 's bill .  so it is 3-card molly .  the house republicans passed both of them , one on the suspension calendar that is not protected here , but is protected in the other body ; and this bill which provides for relief for the taxes for corporate dividends and capital gains , which is protected in our bill , but is not in their bill .  and so what we are doing is shooting dice to see which one will prevail .
