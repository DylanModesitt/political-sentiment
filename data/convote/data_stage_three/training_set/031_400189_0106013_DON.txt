mr. leader , i might say that i think all of us understand the importance of energy legislation .  all of us understand the necessity to become energy independent .  i would suggest , in that framework , that i think personally that we can pass an energy bill .  obviously , there are some items that are in the energy bill or that are proposed for the energy bill that have significant opposition on one side of the aisle or the other .  i would hope , mr. leader , if we could , in working with the various committee chairs , and i suppose most primarily the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton )  and the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell )  in this respect , to come to as bipartisan an agreement on the substance of that bill so that we could see it not just pass through the house of representatives , which may be interesting in terms of the political claim that we passed it , but which does nothing for our energy independence , which is , i think , our objective .  so i would hope that we could deal with this in as bipartisan a fashion as possible so that when we send it to the other body that we may have more success there , more success out of conference , and send a bill to the president that will facilitate both energy independence and the effective and efficient discovery , development , and delivery at retail to the consumer of energy options .  i do not know whether you want to say anything .
