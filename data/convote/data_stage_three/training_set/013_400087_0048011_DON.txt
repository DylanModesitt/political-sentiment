mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  in listening to the sponsor in terms of the need for this legislation , one could intimate by the introduction that possibly medals were given out in a haphazard manner .  i mentioned before it takes two-thirds of the members of the house , the entire body , to introduce a gold medal for its consideration in the committee on financial services , a bar that i believe is a very , very high bar and one that is not easily attained .  i would also point out that limiting this to individuals , and again to reiterate , martin luther king and coretta scott king were both issued the gold medal .  they would not have gotten that medal under this legislation .  harry and eliza briggs , levi pearson , and reverend joseph armstrong delaine were all issued the medal in one provision .  as mentioned before , nancy reagan , along with president reagan , would not have been eligible .  under the provisions today , they would have to get it individually .  betty and gerald ford , the little rock nine , and dr .  graham and ruth graham would not have received it either .  i think therein lies a tremendous flaw .  it also intimates that there may be too many of these gold medals given out .  who that received this medal in the past was not worthy of it ?  was it dr .  martin luther king and coretta scott king ; was it reverend delaine , harry and eliza briggs , and levi pearson ; was it jackie robinson ; was it dorothy height ; tony blair in the last congress ?  in the 106th congress was it nancy reagan ; was it pope john paul , ii ; was it charles schulz , the great cartoonist ?  was it rosa parks ?  who amongst those was not qualified , who do we believe was not deserving of this medal .  therein lies the flaw in this bill .  it actually limits us from giving to those who i believe are most deserving of recognition of this gold medal .
