mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , in this time when a cloud of scandal hangs over washington , when the chief of staff to the vice president of the united states has been indicted for perjury , making false statements , when a top white house official is led away in handcuffs , indicted on charges of making false statements related to an investigation of his dealing with lobbyists , at a time when a top republican lobbyist and fundraiser has been indicted for fraud , when that investigation is the subject of a department of justice investigation , and today over in the other body there is a hearing going on looking into possible other misdealings , at a time when the american people have indicated that they are fed up with scandals , how can this house support a bill that would open up new avenues for corruption to enter the political process ?  the courts have clearly argued that the reason why you can limit campaign contributions is because of corruption and the appearance of corruption .  why would we take a step backwards from campaign finance reform and open up a loophole so big that you could drive a truck through it ?  finally , i keep hearing senator reid 's name mentioned here .  i want to assure you of something .  if the senate brings up this bill , they will get more than 20 minutes a side to discuss it .  they will discuss it for as long as it needs to be discussed .  that is what we should have done here .
