without question probably the most common condition that we see in smoking moms is something called toxemia of pregnancy .  toxemia , by the very word , it is a poison .  we do not know exactly what that poison is , but something occurs in those moms that develop toxemia .  it is not always because of smoking , but frequently it is .  and also so often that condition will lead also to pre-term labor and delivery and one of these low birth weight infants .  in the extreme , toxemia of pregnancy before birth results in a very , very high blood pressure .  it can cause a stroke , a deep coma , one from which sometimes the mother never recovers and the child is lost .  so we are talking about one of the worst complications of pregnancy other than just out and out exsanguination from bleeding , which is also a possibility in any pregnancy .  but smoking , we see that condition more often .  and then , of course , childhood asthma , which i am sure the gentleman has seen plenty of cases of that , youngsters that come in because there is that secondary smoke situation .  not only do they have to suffer with it during the 9 months of pregnancy of their mom ; but once they are born , that smoking continues in the household .  so it is a huge complication , no question about that .
