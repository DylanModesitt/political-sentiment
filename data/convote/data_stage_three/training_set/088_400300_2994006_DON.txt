mr. speaker , i yield myself 15 seconds .  mr. speaker , the gentleman brags about the additional money that the republican congress has put into education .  president clinton and the democrats had to drag them kicking and screaming into providing that money .  we provided $ 19 billion more in education since they took over the congress than would have been provided if we had simply passed the republican house bill .
