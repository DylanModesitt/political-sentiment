mr. speaker , if the gentleman will yield further , obviously we would have liked to have met the statutory deadline of april 15 , but , unfortunately , we will not .  i am advised that the speaker has not yet decided when he would like to appoint the conferees to meet with the senate , but it could occur as early as next week .  hopefully , within the next few weeks we will have a conference report for the house to consider that provides for the extension of the pro-growth tax policies enacted in 2001 and 2003 , reduces non-security discretionary spending , and provides for important reforms of entitlement programs .
