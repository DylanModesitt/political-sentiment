mr. speaker , i come to the floor today in strong opposition to h. con .  res. 36 .  it is a standard practice for institutions of higher learning to include a non-discrimination policy as part of their mission .  these policies affirm that they do not tolerate discrimination on any number of issues : race , sex , religion , age , disability , social class , and sexual orientation .  these non-discrimination policies were created so that all people in our country have the opportunity to be an equal and respected member of higher education communities .  unfortunately the military has established a discriminatory policy , do n't ask do n't tell .  this policy unfairly excludes homosexuals from military service on the basis of their sexual orientation alone .  for example , numerous military linguists who are critically needed in the global war on terrorism have been discharged under do n't ask do n't tell .  supporters of h. con .  res. 36 say that denying military recruiters access to college campuses is a national security threat , but they are completely missing the big picture .  the real national security threat is the do n't ask do n't tell policy that forces our military to discharge gay servicemen and servicewomen regardless of their job performance .  i strongly believe that the non-discrimination policies of colleges and universities should be respected and i urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution .
