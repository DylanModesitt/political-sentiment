mr. chairman , i would simply like to submit my statement for the record on this particular issue in opposition to the real id act .  mr. chairman , i rise today in strong opposition of the real id act .  h.r. 418 is mean-spirited legislation that threatens our national security by depriving law enforcement officials of critical information on many adults who are physically present in the united states .  the driver 's license real id act will also impose additional requirements on states , without providing funding , and interfere with what is inherently a state responsibility .  the real id act will also raise insurmountable hurdles for refugees seeking asylum .  this bill will negatively affect women refugees seeking asylum from honor killings , rape and sex trafficking , since most women can not provide direct proof of torture .  i do not understand how supporters of this bill can turn their backs on victims of sex trafficking in the name of protecting homeland security .  finally , i am particularly disappointed that the authors of this bill have ignored real security threats .  like the need to upgrade the safety of our chemical and nuclear plants .  instead they have introduced a sweeping new law that allows the department of homeland security to unilaterally strip away civil rights , labor , health and environmental laws to build a border fence .  this will be done without any recourse for the average american citizen impacted by the construction .  this does n't make our country safer , it just takes away the liberties that make america a model for the world .  i strongly urge all members to vote `` no '' on h.r. 418 .
