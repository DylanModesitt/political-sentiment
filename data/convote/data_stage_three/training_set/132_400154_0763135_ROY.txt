mr. chairman , i rise to congratulate my good friend , the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton )  , the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce , for his leadership in forging a comprehensive , cohesive energy policy for our nation .  i also applaud the chairman for his attempts to ensure a reliable , efficient , and affordable energy supply .  we all can agree that a transparent energy market is essential to achieving the overall goals of this bill .  i am concerned , however , mr. chairman , that the current language in title 12 , specifically section 1281 , weakens the protections afforded the sensitive and proprietary information used to determine energy prices .  mr. chairman , i seek the assurance of the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton )  that he will work with me and concerned others on language that clarifies the commodity futures trading commission 's exclusive jurisdiction with respect to accounts , agreements , and transactions involving commodity futures and options .  the cftc has a long history of sharing futures and options trading data with other federal and state regulators that agree to abide by the public disclosure restrictions found in section 8 of the commodity exchange act .
