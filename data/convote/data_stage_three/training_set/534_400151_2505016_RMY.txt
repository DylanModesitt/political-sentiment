mr. speaker , i want to point out that this bill on the house side , h.r. 800 , which was passed , as i mentioned earlier by the house judiciary committee , this bill actually had 257 cosponsors , mr. speaker .  so this is certainly not a republican bill .  you can do the math .  my colleagues certainly can do the math on the other side of the aisle .  but clearly , this bill had strong , strong bipartisan support .
