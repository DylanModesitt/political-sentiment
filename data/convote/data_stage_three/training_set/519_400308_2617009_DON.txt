mr. speaker , the gentleman is absolutely right .  the amazing thing to me when i was listening to the republicans in the last hour is when they were trying to make the analogy to their households and talking about their kids .  and one of the republican members talked about how he went down to the candy store and you could only spend what was in your pocket , and that is what we want to do here .  and i was saying , these guys on the republican side of the aisle have been building up deficits ever since president bush came into office .  how do they have the nerve to even talk about making the analogy with their households and going to the candy store when from the day that they arrived they have been increasing the deficit ?
