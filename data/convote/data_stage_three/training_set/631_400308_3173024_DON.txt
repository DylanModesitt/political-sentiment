mr. speaker , i yield myself 30 seconds .  mr. speaker , as one point of clarification regarding the claim made by the gentleman , our chairman , that no select committee was formed to consider the stratton commission recommendations , i believe that the gentleman from maryland was in fact wrong on that .  the senate specifically established a national ocean policy study in the commerce committee for that purpose .
