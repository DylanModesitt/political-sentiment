mr. chairman , as my colleague from texas knows , the electricity title is very , very important to my consumers and my constituents in the southeast as well as in the northwest , and one of the provisions in the title that is not there is regarding participatory funding .  since that is a fairly standard thought-out thing in regional transmission organizations , i am concerned that the bill does not have any language in there to assure me and my constituents that they are not going to have to pay extra .  we do really want to help people that are having blackouts and brownouts , but we do not think we should pay the whole load .  what can i anticipate on participatory funding down the road ?
