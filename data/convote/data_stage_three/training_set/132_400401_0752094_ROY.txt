madam chairman , i appreciate that , and i yield myself 15 seconds .  if we could get the mileage out of the gallon of gasoline that they get out of 1 minute , we would not need an energy policy in this country .  first of all , i want to thank the five democrats on the committee on ways and means who had the courage to vote for this excellent tax provision .  understanding the pressure they are under , based upon the comments that were just made , truly it was a heroic vote .
