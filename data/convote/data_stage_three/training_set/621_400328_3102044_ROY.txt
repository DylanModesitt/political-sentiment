mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , the debate here has been consumed by the discussion of capital gains and dividends , and that is a big part of this and that is appropriate .  but the amt relief component , which has been the source of much recent debate , we dealt with yesterday .  we dealt with it on a vote of 414-4 , overwhelming , bipartisan , on the suspension calendar , which i will remind members under the rule , requires a two-thirds vote to pass .  it is out of here .  the amt relief bill moved through here in an expeditious manner on a bipartisan basis .  what this bill does is provide continued assistance for those people who are saving to go to college .  middle- and low-income students , this is their shot at going to college .  assistance for those who are saving for retirement , seniors , low income , saving through an ira and a pension plan for retirement .  ten states that do not have a state income tax that want the same tax treatment that high-tax states have , this expires in 3 weeks unless we pass the bill .  just one of several important components in this tax relief package .  it is vitally important that we pass this and not allow taxes to go up 3 weeks from now on those 10 states , not allow teachers to lose their deductibility on classroom supplies , not allow low-income seniors and savers to be punished under the democratic plan .  mr. speaker , i urge the members to support the rule and support the underlying bill .  mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution .  the previous question was ordered .  the resolution was agreed to .  a motion to reconsider was laid on the table .
