mr. chairman , let me just note that what measures that we have been suggesting in the bill , as you have just underscored , are very reasonable , and the fact that we have bipartisan support on the measures demanding accountability suggest that these are things that the united nations should not be opposing .  this is nothing that should raise the fur up on the back of the necks of any official at the united nations .  so i appreciate the gentleman , and also , all those ladies and gentlemen on the other side of the aisle coming at these issues of accountability in a very bipartisan fashion .
