mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for that information .  i will ask one more question on the intelligence issue .  does the gentleman know whether the administration is supportive of the position taken by the chairman of the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat on the intelligence committee or not ?  has the administration taken a position on that ?
