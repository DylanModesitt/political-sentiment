mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from michigan ( mr. stupak )  and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher )  if they are on the floor .  i know the gentleman from michigan ( mr. stupak )  is .  i do not know if the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher )  is or not .  first of all , i want to say that i think it is good that we have a democrat substitute .  i think it adds to the debate .  it certainly adds to the fairness of the debate .  but i do have some questions for my good friend from michigan .  on page 2 , title i , section 101 , it basically says if a president has issued a declaration that there is an energy emergency , it begins to talk about a price that is unconscionably excessive .  that is line 4. what is unconscionably excessive ?
