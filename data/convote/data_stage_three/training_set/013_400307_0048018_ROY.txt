mr. chairman , let me point out in the case of the navajo code talkers , there were other tribes also that had code talkers , not just the navajo .  again , the issue is where do we start and where do we finish in this area .  again , going back to the history of the medal , and the first recipient was george washington , it was to an individual and was to an individual for a very , very long period of time .  the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle )  pointed out correctly , historically the gold medal was given out quite rarely , 45 in 123 years , to individuals .  the change ironically was brought about with the change in the commemorative coin program that did in fact move the congress to adopting more gold medals .  this is an effort to try to get back to where history started us , awarding that medal to an individual and awarding it not to a group , no matter how small or how large , and that really was the intent of the legislation .
