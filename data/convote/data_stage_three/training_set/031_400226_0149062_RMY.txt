mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .  mr. chairman , i rise in support of the passage of h.r. 418 .  many of these protections that are contained in this legislation are long overdue .  they are necessary to protect our homeland .  in particular , i am supportive of the provisions that deal with enhancing our driver 's licenses by providing for some uniformity in the standards used to issue those driver 's licenses and for finishing the border fence in southern california .  we ought not to let some vague problem of the environment keep us from finishing this important part of our border security .  but that is one step in the process of border security .  i am serious about the problem of border security .  i represent a district that has more apprehensions of illegal immigrants than any other district on the southern border , in fact , more apprehensions than all the other districts combined .  as someone working hard for a long time to help secure our border , i can confidently say the most effective and efficient way to deal with this is to have comprehensive immigration reform .  the president of the united states has recognized this .  we need to create an avenue for those not crossing for malicious reasons to be funneled through the ports-of-entry along the border .  that will allow us to deal with the real problem .  mr. chairman , i urge us to support h.r. 418 , and then turn our attention to comprehensive immigration reform legislation .
