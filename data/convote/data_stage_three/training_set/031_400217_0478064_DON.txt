mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant support for the $ 81.1 billion emergency supplemental funding bill we are considering today .  the only reason i am voting for the bill before us today is because it provides much needed equipment for our forces in theater , increases death gratuity to $ 100 , 000 for families of soldiers who have died or were killed on active duty .  my support for this measure is tepid at best .  what troubles me the most about this bill are two key concerns : one , there are no mechanisms for tracking if the money is properly spent .  there is simply no mechanism for improving accountability of how taxpayers ' dollars are spent .  the defense department wants to take the money and provide little detail to congress on how these dollars are being used or abused .  the american people have a right to know how these dollars are spent .  and , two , by increasing investments in our war and defense efforts , we further constrain budgetary resources for investments in education , highways , community development , first responders , health care , public health and more .  what is at stake here is the very welfare of our states and communities , who find themselves financially strapped because of the economic policies of this administration .  our domestic economy can not continue to pursue this trend .  despite my many misgivings over this spending bill , i will vote for its passage .  we in congress must call on the defense department to provide better accountability for the spending decisions it makes .
