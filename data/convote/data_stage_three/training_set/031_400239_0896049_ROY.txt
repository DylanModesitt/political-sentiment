mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , let me begin by saying that while i very strongly oppose my colleague from wisconsin 's motion to recommit , the gentleman was kind enough to share the recommittal motion with us before the fact , and i am very much appreciative of that .  the greatest difficulty i have with the motion is that at this moment our forces are on gas fumes , rather than real gasoline .  it is very , very critical that we get this bill moving towards the president 's desk and to the troops as quickly as possible .  i would like to speak for a moment about some of those things that the bill does that may be of great interest to the members who are concerned especially about border security .  within this package there are some 500 border patrol agents , added as a result of this measure as it goes to the president 's desk .  there are 218 immigration enforcement agents and criminal investigators .  there are some 1 , 950 detention beds .  the bill is designed to take every step that we possibly can on short order to secure our border .  at the same time , just yesterday the subcommittee on homeland security marked up their 2006 bill to move further down this same pathway .  we are moving very quickly to strengthen and secure our borders by way of this legislation , as well as regular order .  from there , mr. speaker , let me express my deepest appreciation to members on both sides of the aisle who have worked very hard , their staffs , as well as the members themselves , to make sure that this supplemental would arrive on time and ahead of schedule .  virtually nobody thought we would be here at this moment .  the reason we are is because the members recognize how critical it is that we get this support to our troops immediately .  mr. speaker , i very much appreciate my colleagues ' patience as we work quickly on this bill .  it is a very good bill .  i urge my colleagues ' support .
