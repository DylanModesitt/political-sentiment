mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .  last night , about 12 , 000 mississippians went to bed in somebody else 's house or in their carport or in their car or in their tent .  they are waiting on a fema trailer .  i did not promise them a fema trailer .  the president of the united states did .  he has not fulfilled that promise yet .  it is over 102 days past the storm .  as we speak , there are tens of thousands of mississippians , average joes , who are about to lose their house .  see , they lived outside the flood plain .  they had wind insurance , and a storm of magnitude that has not occurred in 300 years either destroyed or flooded their homes .  now they have no home .  they have a mortgage to pay , and their insurance company , which contributes heavily to the folks over there , says you are not getting a dime because that was water and not wind , but they will use any excuse they can .  i have introduced legislation to try to help those folks , and it is expensive .  it is going to cost about $ 5 billion to help those folks hang on to their homes and hang on to their mortgage ; and in 102 days we have not had a hearing or a vote on it .  but if you are a member of the political contributor class , the guys who write the big checks to the rnc , guys who write a big check to a congressman here , senator there , we have got a vote on your tax cut that does not even expire for 3 years .  you want to know what this house 's priorities are ?  it is not with the average joes .  it is with the political contributor class .  you call them what you want .  you can call them rich , but we all know it comes down to who writes the checks .  by the way , the guy on coleman avenue whose house washed away , he does not write big checks .  so maybe that is why you do not listen to him .  it has been 102 days , and you have done nothing .  there is no talk of doing anything .  there are 12 , 000 mississippians waiting on a fema trailer .  so what do you bring to the floor ?  is it hurricane relief ?  is it something to help the average joes ?  it is a tax break for the wealthiest 1 percent of america who , by the way , write the big checks to the political parties .  tell me your priorities are not screwed up , because i am going to tell you they are .
