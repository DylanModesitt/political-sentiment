madam chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  before i recognize the next speaker , i want to point out that it is not , as i am hearing , that we are obliterating the clean water state revolving fund or the arts funds .  we are funding the arts and humanities $ 259 million , the same as the 2005 year .  we are funding the state revolving fund $ 850 million , the same as we did in 2005 .  unfortunately , with the costs and the deficit we have now , we can not continue to put more and more in .  we are trying to do the best we can by consistently funding our needs in this area .
