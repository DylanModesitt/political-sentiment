mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. chairman , let me just reiterate that i think it is vitally important that we have a commission to look at the whole medicaid program , because it is getting extremely expensive .  and we want to have the best possible information and ideas as the congress prospectively tries to address the burgeoning costs of medicaid , and , of course , as a corollary to that medicare .  they are tasked with producing recommendations to achieve $ 10 billion in medicaid savings .  and i can not believe the body would not want to at least have a commission to look at the problem that is obviously looming on the horizon .  mr. chairman , therefore , i would urge my colleagues to vote against this if it were to come to a vote .  we are going to be confronted with some very difficult choices in the future , as we found out on the social security issue .  and i think the medicaid-medicare issue will be even more challenging in the years ahead .  and so now is the time to get as much information , as many ideas as we possibly can , to address a very difficult problem .
