mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman from texas for yielding me this time .  i would like to join in the point that is being made by the gentlewoman from texas to remind all of our friends that when republicans took power in 1994 , they made a solemn promise to the states that they would make sure that there would be no imposition of unfunded mandates on those states , and today we have a chance to redeem that promise by voting `` no '' on consideration of this rule , which waives the unfunded mandate requirement .  the majority may , if they have not already , attempt to argue that it is a minor mandate and show new and improved cbo estimates showing that the cost of this bill is only $ 125 million over the next 5 years ; and , therefore , i think this warrants at minimum committee hearings in markups that has so far been denied this congress .  so we are not asking a lot this afternoon .  and i am impressed by the governors association .  their letter points out that while they commend the gentleman from michigan ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. tom davis ) for their commitment to driver 's license integrity , they find that those bills would impose technological standards and verification procedures on states , many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government .  moreover , the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver 's licenses issued by the states represents a massive unfunded mandate .  so they close by urging us to allow the provisions of the intelligence reform act of 2004 to work .  so i commend the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee )  for making such a very timely and important point of order , and i support her in it .
