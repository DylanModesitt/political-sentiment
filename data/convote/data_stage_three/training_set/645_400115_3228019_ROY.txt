will the gentleman yield ?  i have yielded 2 minutes to the gentleman .  i think he still has time .  i just would like to say that i believe that the resolution that has been brought forward is one which recognizes the directive , the call from the president of iraq .  it recognizes the sense of the men and women in uniform who are on the ground there .  and i believe that an overwhelming majority , and i will say to my friend , there may be some republicans who choose to vote against this measure .  i do n't know that every republican is going to vote in support of this resolution , but this resolution underscores the importance of victory in iraq .
