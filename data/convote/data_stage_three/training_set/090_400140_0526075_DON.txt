mr. speaker , i yield myself 15 seconds .  we just heard what would have made an excellent summary in the legal case in this matter , but not a legislative argument .  we heard very specific allegations and arguments which are hotly contested about the individual case .  the americans with disabilities act was a general law .  it has nothing to do with this individual case here .
