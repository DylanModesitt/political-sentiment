mr. speaker , the preemption of state law that is allowed under h.r. 525 makes no sense .  for example , 49 states guarantee that health insurance plans include mammograms , and for good reason .  we know that if a woman has health insurance , the likelihood she will receive a mammogram is promising .  we know that early detection increases a woman 's chance of surviving breast cancer .  no one knows this better than my constituents in marin county , california , who suffer from the highest rates of breast cancer in the country .  they deserve more protections from this deadly disease , not a rollback in coverage of the most basic screening tool we have , mammograms .  they are looking to congress to help more women get the services they need to catch this disease before it becomes fatal .  instead , today we are telling them that insurance companies are allowed to trump state law and decide what is best for their health .  i am sure that all of the men and women here today want their wives , sisters , mothers , and daughters to have annual screenings as recommended by physicians .  it is common sense .  i urge each of my colleagues , support the women in your lives .  support the motion to recommit .
