mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit largely because i believe on both sides of the aisle the body recognizes that the reason for this supplemental is to provide as quickly as possible money flows in support of our troops .  this is a supplemental dealing with our challenges in the middle east especially .  it is a supplemental dealing with the crises that have resulted from the tsunami .  but , in the meantime , the gentlewoman is suggesting that we should recommit this bill to add $ 150 million .  the best thing that we can do for our troops is to move this bill very quickly and send it on its way for a conference with the senate .  there is absolutely no question that to have a recommittal motion be successful that would add $ 150 million to an $ 82 billion package , the vast percentage of which is in support of our troops , at best is a technical exercise .  to recommit for the sake of recommitting is not a reflection of how seriously we are taking the challenge we have of supporting our troops .  so i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit , and i urge members on both sides of the aisle to recognize that we must move forward with this supplemental .
