mr. chairman , today i voted in support of the fiscal year 2005 iraq and tsunami relief supplemental .  this decision was difficult for me .  i strongly opposed the real id act of 2005 .  the real id act has no place on a bill to fund support for our military families and tsunami victims .  in fact , i voted against h.r. 418 when it was considered by the u.s. house of representatives on february 10 , 2005 .  this type of political game was vicious attempt to portray those who believe real id is a bad policy as unpatriotic , and i refuse to make servicemembers and their families ' losers of that game .  i voted for this spending bill because it includes equipment and services that our troops and their families need desperately .  it includes additional funds for health care services , mental health for veterans , active duty servicemembers and their families , and financial assistance to help members of the national guard transition back into civilian life .  this legislation also provides an increase in the amount of life insurance for troops , an increase in the death benefit for families of fallen military members , and provides additional funding so our troops have the armored humvees and personal protection they need while serving in iraq .  with the knowledge we have today about the lack of protective equipment and inability of our system to serve military families , i do not believe that withholding funds from our military families and tsunami victims is the right way to solve the predicament the bush administration has created .  i remain very concerned about the bush administration 's lack of a clear exit strategy in iraq and i will continue to fight for real immigration reform and for a clear plan so our troops can come home and democracy can thrive in an iraq run by iraqis .
