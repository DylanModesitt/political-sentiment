mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me .  we called for reformulated gasoline .  we did not spell out how that was to be done .  we did not spell out the technology .  we said to the oil companies , you figure out how to do it .  they could have done it with ethanol .  they chose reformulated gasoline .  what we wanted was cleaner gasoline , and they did not have to use mbte .
