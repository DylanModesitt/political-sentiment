mr. speaker , i yield myself 35 seconds .  mr. speaker , i am a friend of the internet .  in fact , i sponsored legislation that would exempt bloggers from fec legislation .  but the issue is how we draw the lines to balance .  we do not exempt the internet from laws controlling child pornography ; we do not allow child pornography on the internet .  we do not exempt the internet from consumer safety laws .  we do not exempt the internet from intellectual property or copyright laws .  we do not because we think those laws are important .  we wrestle with the details of unavoidable and unintended consequences .  why do we do the hard work of wading through the details ?  because why would we do anything else ?  why should we disregard the integrity of the political process ?
