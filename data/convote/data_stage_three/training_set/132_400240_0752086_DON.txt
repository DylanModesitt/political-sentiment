madam chairman , i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. stark )  for yielding me time .  madam chairman , gas prices are going up every single day , and this bill does nothing to bring down the costs at the pump .  in fact , it might just make the problem worse .  the energy czars must be the majority leader and company , and they wrote this bill behind closed doors .  this bill is immoral .  it is a shame and it is a disgrace .  this bill was conceived in darkness and born in a den of iniquity .  this bill does not do one thing to bring down the price of gasoline at the pump .  we can do better .  we can do much better .  we should vote against this bill .
