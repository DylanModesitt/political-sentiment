mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  i would like to urge a `` no '' vote on the rule , a `` no '' vote on the bill , and say to every member of the house of representatives if they want the amt fix protected , the only way in the world they can do it today is to vote for the democrat substitute .
