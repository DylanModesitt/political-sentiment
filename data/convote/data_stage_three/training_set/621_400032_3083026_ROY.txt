talking about our homes and construction and home sales .  in october , home sales reached 7.1 units in october .  and the thing that is so interesting is that is just off the historic high of home sales which was in june of this year when there were 7.3 units that were built or were sold .  so whether it is new homes being built , whether it is existing homes , the home sales , how amazing that we are seeing home sales reaching such high numbers in both the new construction and the existing home sales category .
