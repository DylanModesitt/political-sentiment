mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i just want to point out to the members that yesterday the house passed the gulf opportunities zone act 415-4 which dealt with many items to help gulf coast area residents who had been hurt by the hurricane , incentives to help rebuild housing , investment to provide depreciation and expensing for small businesses , bonding authority so that tax-exempt bond authority could help rebuild devastated infrastructure in the hurricane zone .  so this house has acted to help hurricane victims .
