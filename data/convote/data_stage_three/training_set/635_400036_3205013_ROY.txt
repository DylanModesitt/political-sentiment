i will be happy to do so .  mr. price of georiga .  as you and i are both aware , the airline industry continues to amass losses as the industry strives to become more dynamic , both externally and internally .  losses during the last 4 years have proven that the business model used by legacy carriers is outdated but under duress by high-fuel prices and post-9/11 repercussions .  a primary component playing into the equation of legacy carrier viability is the pension systems currently in place .  the current model of defined benefit pension plans and the rules associated with it have come under scrutiny as two legacy carriers , making up approximately 20 percent of the domestic airline market , recently terminated their employee pension plans .  there are no winners when airlines default on their pension plans .  employees now are planning for a retirement with a fraction of what they were originally promised , and further , the pension benefit guaranty corporation , the government agency and guarantor of all pension plans , is put more and more into the red , and taxpayers are exposed to greater risk .  eventually , the point will be reached when taxpayers have to bail out the pbgc if no action is taken .  with these concerns in mind , i would ask the chairman to agree to work with me and the gentleman from minnesota ( mr. kline )  to develop a process , as the senate has done , to provide airlines with the flexibility needed to fund their defined benefit pension systems over a long amortization period .  i believe it is critical that we join with the senate in this effort and through the conference process to develop final legislation that contains industry-specific reform for the airlines .  madam speaker , reclaiming my time , let me thank my colleague from georgia for his work on this issue for lo these many months .
