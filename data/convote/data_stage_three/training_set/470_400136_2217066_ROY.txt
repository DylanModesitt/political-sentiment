mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i wish the perpetrator would have thought about the penalties before they committed the crime .  the minimum mandatory may tie the hands of judges , but it will , in fact , tie the hands of the predator .  they know full well before they are released what the requirements are , and if there is confusion , it is the perpetrator 's fault .  i do not want it to be relied upon the victim to say the victim should have known he may have been a perpetrator but we were not registered .
