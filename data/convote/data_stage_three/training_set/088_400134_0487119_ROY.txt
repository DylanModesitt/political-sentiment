mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from texas for helping put together this package and for all the work that he has done on behalf of the republican study committee and for all of my colleagues there that have worked so hard on this alternative budget .  i want to also commend the gentleman from iowa ( mr. nussle )  for the budget that is presented here .  it makes cuts of .7 percent in nondefense discretionary .  finally , we are actually doing what families would do when a large deficit looms in the future , though we need to do far more than that .  this budget would cut 2 percent .  when you look at what lies ahead , when you look at the unfunded liabilities that lie ahead , this is kid stuff .  we are going to have to do much , much more in the future .  if we are inching toward bankruptcy in social security , we are flat running toward it with medicare .  and when you look at the liabilities there , we added $ 7 trillion in unfunded liabilities with the medicare prescription drug bill , for example , that we are going to have to somehow deal with , that our kids and grandkids are going to have to somehow deal with .  we have got to get ahold of this deficit .  the problem is not tax cuts .  that is part of the solution .  we need more revenue coming in .  you do that by cutting taxes .  we have seen that time and time again .  the problem here is spending .  there is a culture of spending in this institution that is just difficult to stop .  this alternative budget makes some progress toward that end , but i again want to stress this is kid stuff compared to what we are going to have to do in the coming years to get a handle on this culture of spending .  i commend my colleagues for putting this forward .  i urge this house to support it .
