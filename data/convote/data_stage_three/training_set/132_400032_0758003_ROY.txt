madam speaker , i thank the gentleman so much for his thoughts , and i thank him for his leadership on the committee on energy and commerce , and the gentleman from texas is exactly right .  this is an issue about the future .  it is an issue that affects our children , and as he said , it is an issue about the economy , about security and how we need to look at our sources of oil , our security , and many times we feel we are too reliant on foreign oil , which we are .  right now , 62 percent of the nation 's oil supply is coming from foreign sources .  if we do not take action and pass an energy bill , it is going to be 75 percent by 2010 .  so we know that action is necessary and it is needed now .  the gentleman from texas also mentioned new technologies , new ways of doing things , and that is something that certainly we have to have our eye towards .  we look at the needs for today and then as we bridge to the future .
