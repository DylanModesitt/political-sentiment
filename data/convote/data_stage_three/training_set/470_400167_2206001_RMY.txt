mr. speaker , sometimes numbers paint a dramatic picture .  according to a survey conducted by the u.s. department of justice , one in five children 10 to 17 years old are recipients of unwanted sexual solicitations online .  one of every seven victims of sexual assault is under the age of 6. one in five girls will be sexually exploited before they reach adulthood .  and one in 10 boys will become victims before they become men .  according to the national center for missing and exploited children , the whereabouts of 100 , 00 to 150 , 000 of some 500 , 000 sexual offenders currently registered in the united states are unknown .  what is known is that we are not powerless .  i fully support the measures included in the child safety act .  the passage of this bill will do nothing to bring about the safe return of children like carlie brucia , a sarasota girl scout who was brutally victimized and murdered by a sexual predator .  however , it will save other families the most undeniable anguish of losing a child to the most unthinkable acts of violence .  this bill takes commonsense steps toward ensuring sex offenders are not free to prey on the most vulnerable members of our society .  h.r. 3132 will require states to alert other states when sexual offenders seek other locations .  there are many , many things that keep parents awake at night .  passage of this bill should not be one of those .
