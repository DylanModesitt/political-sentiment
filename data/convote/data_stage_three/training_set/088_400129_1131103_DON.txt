mr. chairman , as the chairman is aware , i have raised concerns about the plans to build a new usgs laboratory in santa cruz .  actually i am thrilled to have usgs moving into my district , but the usgs will benefit greatly from the synergy of other local marine science facilities in the area , including the university of california 's long marine lab and the united states government 's national marine fisheries service lab .  with usgs collocated near these other facilities , i believe the united states will have the best marine science information anywhere .  but in the development of the plans for the lab , we run into contradictory budget numbers and laboratory configurations that have dogged final approval for getting this project off the ground , and it has really been a problem .  and i appreciate your consideration of being willing to work with me to facilitate the meeting of the principals involved in this project and resolve some of these questions once and for all .
