mr. chairman , the comprehensive energy package that we pass today is a major step forward in our ability to provide certainty in the united states ' energy sector .  this legislation is the result of hundreds of hours of work developing a plan that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil , improve our economy , and create jobs .  this legislation improves our nation 's electricity transmission and reliability .  it provides for safer , stable and more reliable energy sources within our own country , making us less reliant on oil from the middle east .  clean coal technology and incentives for renewable energies are a key part to the future of energy production and consumption in this country .  domestic oil and gas exploration will make us less susceptible to the rising prices of foreign energy sources .  and let us not forget that this bill does something for american families .  as gas prices climb , it becomes more and more expensive to take our children to sports games , visit out-of-town family , and even drive .  to work .  we need relief from high gas prices and this legislation is a step in that direction .
