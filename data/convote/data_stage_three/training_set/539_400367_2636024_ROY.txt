mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , the gentleman from kansas city very clearly articulated the exact reason why this bill is moving forward , and the reason why chairman richard baker and the chairman of the committee , chairman mike oxley , have moved forward a bill that is so powerful , that will include more dollars .  but i believe that the argument that is here is about politics , pure and simple politics , rather than policy .  and this bill is about policy .  it is about getting millions of dollars that will be given to the source at which we will create more and better housing for really poor people .  the gentleman referred to him being a member of the united methodist church .  i am a member of the united methodist church .  when you look at a web site for habitat for humanity , you will see large corporations on that list who contribute to new houses in this country , not-for-profits and others ; and number four on that list is my church , of the entire country , my church the highland park united methodist church of dallas , texas .  we build houses in dallas , texas , for poor people , people who are without that ability for their families .  but what we are asking here is the ability to move this bill to create thousands of more homes .  and i think what mike oxley wants in this bill is to make it about policy , not about politics .  and i am proud of how we are doing this .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
