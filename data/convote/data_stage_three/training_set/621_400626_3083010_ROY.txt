mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentlewoman 's pointing out the increase in tax revenue and the gentleman from texas pointing that out , because it is lost on some folks .  it was not lost on president kennedy , by the way , nor was it lost on president reagan , who understood clearly that if you decrease tax rates for individuals and corporations , what happens is that the economy becomes vibrant .  it becomes enthusiastic in its zeal .  and what happens is that you increase tax revenue .  this is a chart that shows the tax revenue , total tax revenue for the nation in 2003 of $ 1.78 trillion .  and , remember , that is when the tax relief , the tax cuts went into effect .  as the gentlewoman and the gentleman from texas so clearly stated , now we have tax revenue of $ 2.14 trillion in 2005 .  and that is a done deal .  that is fiscal year 2005 .  that year is over .  that year is over .  so what we see is a decrease in tax rates for individuals and corporations and an increase in tax revenue .  and as has been so clearly stated , if we allow , if congress allows the democrat tax increase that they are planning on this week , if we allow that to occur , then what we will see is a decrease in revenue and a decrease in the vibrancy of the economy .
