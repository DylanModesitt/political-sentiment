mr. speaker , i thank my friend and colleague on the committee on rules , the gentleman from utah ( mr. bishop )  , for yielding me this time ; and i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation , the small business health fairness act .  mr. speaker , a trip to the doctor should not bust the family budget .  too many of america 's small business employees go without health insurance or pay a big chunk of their paycheck for health care .  this house has acted on four separate occasions in a bipartisan way to pass reforms that will allow small business owners to provide their employees with affordable health insurance options , yet our efforts to help reduce the ranks of the uninsured has not gone forward .  this crucial legislation allows small business owners to have similar purchasing power for health insurance as large corporations .  the creation of association health plans will permit small business owners to band together through a trade association or other method to purchase health insurance for them and their employees .  the ability to provide health insurance is critical for our small businesses to remain competitive .  mr. speaker , workers are frustrated with paying the high cost of health care .  congress needs to finish this job and pass association health plans into law .  i urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation .
