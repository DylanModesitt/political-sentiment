reclaiming my time , and the gentleman may want to respond .  let me just comment .  there is an avenue , i would suggest to my friend from new york , to honor large groups .  that would be the commemorative coin .  it is somewhat ironic that after the reforms that were made by the gentleman from delaware where we tightened the restrictions on commemorative coins , and for good reason , that we then had this increase in the gold medal .  i think we can safely say that the gold medal traditionally supports the concept of honoring an individual for service to the country , and that the commemorative coin , which has been essentially put on the back burner , presents a very appropriate avenue for recognizing groups that heretofore have not been honored .  i think that the reforms in the past and the ones that the gentleman from delaware is now propounding in this bill makes excellent sense .  i think once the members understand the changes , that they are going to gravitate toward the concept of a commemorative coin as opposed to the gold medal .  that is precisely what the gentleman from delaware proposes in this legislation .
