mr. speaker , given the stated interest in democracy here in the house , i would ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to permit for division of the question so that we could express our unanimous support for the various provisions of this resolution , except for that on which we have disagreement as to the best way to achieve success in iraq .  at this point , so that we can have the kind of democracy that occurred this week in iraq , of which the majority seems so proud , and actually have it right here on the floor of the house , i ask unanimous consent for a division of the question on the provisions of this resolution .
