mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions )  for yielding me time .  many of you have heard the story about the fellow that was sitting on his porch and water came trickling through his yard .  a fellow drove by in his jeep and said , jump on , the dam is giving way ; this place is going to be flooded .  and he said , i 've got faith in god ; god is going to save me .  the guy drives off .  here comes more water .  here comes a boat .  the guy in the boat says , jump in , there is more water coming .  the guy , no , i have faith in god ; god is going to save me .  and he climbs up on the rooftop as the water gets higher and higher .  here comes a helicopter .  he drops a ladder and with a megaphone says , grab hold of the ladder .  the man says , no , i have got faith in god ; god is going to save me .  the water gets higher .  the man drowns .  he goes to heaven .  he says , god i had faith in you .  why did you not save me ?  god said , i sent you a jeep and a boat and helicopter , why did you not make use of it ?  when we hear people crying today , we need oil , we need gasoline with prices that are down , we need natural gas prices to come down , i can not help but hear this small voice saying , use what i gave you .  this nation has been so richly blessed with so much in the way of resources .  it is time to end the excuses .  we can always find excuses , things we do not like about any bill .  they sure do that down the hall .  it is time to end the excuses .  it is time down the hall to finally do the right thing and use the resources with which this nation has been so richly blessed .
