mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i appreciate the gentleman 's comments .  i look forward to that constructive effort because we share that passion that those 55 and older , those at or near retirement , will not be impacted .  but by golly , we have got an obligation to those people who are under 35 or under 45 or whatever number we finally arrive at , people who have time to plan and people who know , and all of us know , of all stripes , that there will be a problem in either 2040 or 2041 or 2042 .  we can argue over months and weeks all day long , but the point is we are not doing anything to take care of that first-year teacher , that first-year firefighter , that first-year soldier that all of us stand up on a regular basis and claim to speak for .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
