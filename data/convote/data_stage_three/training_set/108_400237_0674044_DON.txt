i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his leadership .  mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule and to this morally bankrupt bill that puts corporate greed over fairness for ordinary folks .  this bill takes the phrase `` kick them when they are down '' to a whole new level .  what about the fact that half of the people who file for bankruptcy protection are forced to do so because of high medical costs , loss of a job , or scam loan sharks ?  this bill would say to these people , the answer is , of course , too bad .  make no mistake , mr. speaker , this bill is a big-time corporate payoff that was drafted with one overriding goal in mind , that is , profits , profits , profits .  i am all for curbing abuses in bankruptcy and would suggest that we start by closing bankruptcy loopholes for millionaires and taking steps to address predatory lending and payday loans rather than a one-sided , harsh industry payoff .  this bill should include real solutions to address the really hard problems fueling the financial difficulties so many in this nation are facing .  we should focus on the true abusers and not the working families that have played by the rules .  mr. speaker , we need to have a bankruptcy bill that addresses the real abusers .  this is a morally bankrupt bill .
