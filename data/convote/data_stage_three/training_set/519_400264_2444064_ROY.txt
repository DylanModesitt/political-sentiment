mr. chairman , as you know , the high energy costs are having a very negative effect on the low income home energy assistance program , and many state liheap programs are expecting a major increase in applications and need for additional funding immediately to help ensure low-income families and seniors can afford to heat their homes .  i recently joined with more than 100 of my colleagues in writing to the committee on appropriations members requesting $ 1.276 billion in additional liheap funding , and i hope , mr. chairman , that you would work with me and other members who share those concerns to make sure this very important assistance program will be available to those who need it in the upcoming winter heating season .
