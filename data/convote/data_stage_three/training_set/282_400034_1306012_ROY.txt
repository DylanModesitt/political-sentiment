mr. speaker , if i could comment , i would say that we are eager to reach a final understanding on this .  but , also , we are eager to be sure that whatever commitments were made and were reached between the administration and the chairman of a significant committee in the house are fully understood and fully complied with .  you know , there can be misunderstandings in these kind of discussions , certainly , but we want to be sure that any commitments made by the administration to the congress and the chairman of its significant committees are fulfilled and , if there are misunderstandings , to be sure that those misunderstandings are worked out before we move forward .  i assure the gentleman that we will be encouraging in that discussion and facilitating it in every way that we can so that it moves forward at the quickest possible time .
