mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  first , let me say that i am glad that the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. baker )  indicated the status of the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle )  , because i would not have wanted him to have been an unindicated co-contributor .  i think that was very helpful .
