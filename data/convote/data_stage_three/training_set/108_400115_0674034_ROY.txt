i have yielded three times .  if i could finish my statement , i would like to .  we have other people who would like to participate .  i know that my dear friend from florida ( mr. hastings )  will be more than happy to yield further time to the gentleman from massachusetts .  mr. speaker , we have been waiting for years and years and years to get to the point where we could get a measure to the desk of the president of the united states so that he can sign it , so that we can deal with this issue and finally bring about responsible reform of our bankruptcy law .  we happen to believe very passionately that people should be accountable for their actions .  we do not want anyone to be deprived of access to file for bankruptcy , but we know full well that this has been abused for such a long period of time .  that is why we are here today and that is why i am convinced , mr. speaker , that even though we will see opposition to this rule , at the end of the day , we will see very strong bipartisan support to reform our bankruptcy law .
