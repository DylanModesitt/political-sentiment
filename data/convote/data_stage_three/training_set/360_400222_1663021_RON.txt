mr. speaker , both the wall street journal and the new york times agree , a rare event , that we should not interfere with free markets in this way .  america stands for freedom , and that means not just voting for who we want , speaking the way we want , but also the right to buy and sell from whoever we wish .  i remember when japanese investors moved to buy rockefeller center , at inflated prices , and many in this body wanted to stop that deal .  we did not .  and only a few years later the japanese sold it back to the united states for pennies on the dollar .  bottom line , we made a killing .  and americans are better off for letting the market work .  if we take this action , china could rightfully cancel american investments in china now totaling $ 25 billion .  wal-mart , conoco , motorola , united air lines all bought companies in china and should be allowed to do so .  we should recover the conviction of our own convictions , especially in our republican party , to make sure we let the market work and let efficiency and fair play rule the day .
