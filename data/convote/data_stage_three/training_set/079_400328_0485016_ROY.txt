mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i thank the gentleman and the previous speakers for drawing attention to the looming crisis that impacts people my age in social security , the people who frankly have come to the conclusion that unless congress acts sooner rather than later , there will not be that program and that dramatic and important action is needed .  but coming back to the rule on the budget , which is the order of the day , it is also good to know that it is more about what reforms we will be taking up later this year are dominating the discussion , which i take to mean and assume to mean that the overall and underlying budget itself is a sound one and that the rule is fair .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
