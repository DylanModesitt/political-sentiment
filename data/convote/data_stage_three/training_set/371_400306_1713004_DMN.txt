mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i want to make my comments on this bill very briefly .  essentially , h.r. 741 weakens the fundamental policy of the secretary of labor while enhancing the powers of the osha commission .  such action would create two divided regulators and a great deal of confusion .  the secretary of labor is best able to regulate and enforce safety standards , and as such , the authority should remain with her .  this is just plain common sense .  i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on h.r. 741 .  we do not need more confusion .  more confusion is only a way to trivialize and make osha less effective .  mr. speaker , i would like to turn my attention to an issue that should be of great concern to all members of this body in relation to this particular subject , and that is worker deaths and serious injuries .  between 5 , 000 and 6 , 000 american workers are killed on the job every year by willful and negligent safety violations on the part of errant employers .  i have talked about that already .  the surviving family members killed by corporate wrongdoing deserve much more than just our sympathy , however .  they deserve immediate congressional attention and action .  instead of considering these bills to weaken osha , we should be strengthening provisions of the occupational safety and health act .  we should be considering a bill like h.r. 2004 , the protecting america 's workers act , which i introduced on april 28 to coincide with workers ' memorial day , a day set aside every year to honor workers killed on the job by safety violations .
