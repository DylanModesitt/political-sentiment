mr. speaker , as i listen to these statements made about public opinion polls , i would like to point to my colleagues the abc news poll about which my friend referred .  seventy-one percent of the iraqis polled said that their lives were very good or quite good ; 61 percent reported the security situation is very good or quite good in the area where they reside ; 64 percent said they expect their lives to be much or somewhat better a year from now .  i know that my friend from ohio is introducing a resolution , he spoke about it earlier today , talking about the independence and the iraqis making a choice as far as our presence .  the iraqi president , jalal talabani , made it very clear in an editorial that he wrote in the wall street journal .  he said : `` a timetable will aid the terrorists and tell them that all they have to do is wait .  military plans must be flexible .  we should have the suppleness to respond to the often-changing level of terrorist threat. '' that is not an american military leader making that statement .  that is the president of iraq .
