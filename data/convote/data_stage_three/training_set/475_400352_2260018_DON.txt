mr. speaker , i am going to make a prediction .  the hour is late , but i am going to make a prediction .  the american people will not allow , will not allow the republican party to get away with having another white wash .  they are not going to allow them to scrub this up and cover this up and clean it up without having proper oversight .  seventy percent of the people in this country want an independent commission to look at this , or a bipartisan commission to look at this .  and i think until that happens , the republican party will continue to get pressure from the american people .  i think the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi )  is going to stand strong .  and , quite frankly , again , we should not appoint anybody to this commission .  eleven republicans , nine democrats , we do not have an ounce of power on this thing , and we will get slammed just like we do every day down here , and the end result will be a fema that continues to be inept and inadequate in its response to natural disasters .  so i say that the american people , that 70 percent of them who want this independent commission will not let this go , will not let the corruption and the cronyism continue .  mr. speaker , 30somethingdems @ mail.house.gov. , send us an e-mail .  we will be back here next week for a couple more nights and keep hammering away .  we are not going to let go until we get the kind of commission that the american people want , that is only fair , and that will best fix the problems that we have in fema right now , because it will have proper oversight .
