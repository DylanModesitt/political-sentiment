mr. chairman , in politics there are show horses and there are work horses .  this process , instead of seeking a solution , only sought headlines .  we had an opportunity to make real progress and address the concerns of these tribes .  instead of addressing this issue in a substantive manner in committee , we are once again addressing it in a political way on the floor of the house simply for political gain .
