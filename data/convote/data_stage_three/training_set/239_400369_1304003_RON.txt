mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , this morning the house considers the withdrawal of the united states from the world trade organization .  i strongly oppose this resolution and urge my members to join me in this opposition .  as a member of the world trade organization , the united states is one of 148 member countries .  our role in this global body is tremendously important , not only for the future of the united states trade but for the continuation of global trade liberalization .  as the world 's leading economy , the largest economy that has ever been on the face of this earth , we all too often focus our attention on the aspects of trade we disagree with .  when members of congress meet with our international counterparts , we spend a large amount of time discussing specific trade barriers and little time supporting the broad range of cooperation and successes that we may share .  continued membership in the world trade organization will allow the united states the opportunity to continue cooperating as we work towards free trade benefiting united states consumers , farmers , manufacturers and firms .  currently , the world trade organization is negotiating the doha round .  congress has been deeply involved with the administration as the round continues to move forward .  it is tremendously importantly that we remain active in these negotiations and push for a completed doha .  finally , i congratulate mr. pascal lamy of france on his selection as the new world trade organization director general .  i am hopeful his abilities will enable the world trade organization to balance the concerns of its members .  i look forward to working with him in the future .  finally , mr. speaker , it is my strong view that the united states greatly benefits from our continued participation in the world trade organization .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
