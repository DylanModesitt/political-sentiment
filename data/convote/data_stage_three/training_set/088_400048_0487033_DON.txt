mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from south carolina ( mr. spratt )  for his leadership on this budget matter .  shame , shame , shame .  i can not believe the republican budget .  our men and women that serve this country are putting their lives on the line , and what are we doing ?  cutting benefits and refusing service .  i am reminded of the words of the first president of the united states , george washington , whose words are worth repeating over and over again .  `` the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war , no matter how justified , should be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars are treated and appreciated. '' the independent budget puts support by the veterans community as $ 300 billion short .  i say that president bush 's budget and the house republican bush budget should be dead on arrival .  let me repeat that .  i said that bush 's budget and the house republican budget as it relates to veterans should be dead on arrival .  on top of all of this , this budget tells the veteran 's affairs committee , which i am on , to find $ 800 million in cuts over the next 5 years for savings .  you know , the republicans practice what i call reverse robin hood , robbing from the veterans to give tax cuts to the rich .  the president keeps telling us we are at war .  well , put your money where your mouth is .
