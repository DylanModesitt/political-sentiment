mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i thank the leader for his comments and observations .  we are certainly hopeful on our side , and i know the gentleman is on his side , that we get this bill through .  it is probably as significant a jobs creation bill as we will pass in this congress , and it has been delayed for a very long period of time .  i know the gentleman has been frustrated by it , and we have been frustrated by it , and hopefully , we can get that done by next week .  the energy bill conference report , can the gentleman tell us where that stands ?
