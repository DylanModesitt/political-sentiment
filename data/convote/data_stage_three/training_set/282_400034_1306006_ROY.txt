certainly based on the experience we have had for the last three fridays , the cooperation of both the ranking member and the leadership of the chairman and the subcommittee chairmen on the appropriations committee , we have been seeing this work go a little faster than we had anticipated .  that could happen again next friday .  the experience again of the last three fridays would lead one to believe that , but next week we will adopt the same approach .  we will get this work done early if we can but would advise members to plan to be here on friday because we will want to complete the entire agenda that we have laid out for next week 's schedule .
