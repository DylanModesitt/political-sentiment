mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute .  let me simply say that i think we will continue to have discussions as relates to mandatory minimums .  i think this bill has great purpose ; i think it is important , however , for us to raise those issues .  i will conclude by saying that we have a long way to go in the criminal justice system , and i hope that we will also bring to the floor of the house this whole issue of early release for those who are languishing in prisons .  i hope the good time early release bill for nonviolent prisoners in our federal prisons who are over 40 years old will have an opportunity for full debate , because they all go hand-in-hand .
