mr. speaker , 15 years ago or so i worked with colleagues in the senate on the difficult issues relating to the wishes of people who were going to receive medical care if they were incapacitated .  we required that state laws be told to patients about living wills and advance directives .  the florida judicial system has worked hard to follow its laws and to try to discern what was or would have been the wishes of mrs. schiavo .  section 1 of the bill says : `` the u.s. district court for the middle district of florida shall have jurisdiction to hear , determine and render judgment on a suit or claim by or on behalf of mrs. schiavo for the alleged violation of any of her rights under the constitution or federal laws. '' that court has already addressed that issue , it did so just a few days ago , and here is what it decided : `` the court finds there is not a substantial likelihood the petitioners will prevail on their federal constitutional claim. '' that is the same court to whom you are sending this case .  and the supreme court of our country denied review .  so essentially what you are doing now for one case is changing the federal rules , for one case , and saying there shall be a de novo hearing , disregarding everything that has happened through the state courts and federal courts until now .  in a word , what you are doing is allowing the rule of law of this country to be twisted in the winds .  it is a mistake .
