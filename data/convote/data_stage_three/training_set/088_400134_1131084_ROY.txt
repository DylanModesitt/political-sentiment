mr. chairman , let me just read this statement .  it seems the washington post has some sympathy for this : `` the federal government is the largest landowner in washington .  since the land can not be taxed , the federal government is the principal contributor to the district 's chronic fiscal imbalance. '' now , if the federal government owns a lot of land in the district of columbia , believe me , arizona , utah , nevada , california , colorado , we ought to really be hurting , because the incidence of federal land is so much higher there .  the president had initially more than $ 200 million for federal land acquisition .  it has been cut by the chairman down to $ 43 million .  it is still too much , and particularly when pilt is underfunded .
