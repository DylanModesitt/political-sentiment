mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the real id act , and i want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner )  , for his efforts in this matter .  it is very important .  this bill is about common sense .  it is about protecting our borders and making our country safer .  the 9/11 commission report revealed many disconcerting facts , none more unnerving than the fact that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers who were here temporarily obtained valid driver 's licenses , enabling them to travel freely about the country .  that is absurd , and the american people know it .  this bill finally does something about that absurdity .  we can not continue to let our laws be exploited and circumvented by future terrorists to further their plans of violence , destruction , and murder .  with the real id act in place , we can better prevent future tragic events from occurring .  mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to pass this critical piece of legislation .
