thank you .  my good friend mr. dreier  suggested that there will not be a divisive debate this morning .  that divisive debate has already begun .  you need to listen to the words of what my colleagues are saying .  i attempted to avoid this divisive debate this morning .  i attempted at the end of this session to have this congress go home with a unanimous vote congratulating the iraqi people on what they have done ; congratulating our military , our allies and the iraqi forces for making it possible for them to vote .  there are divisions on policy , and it is an ostrich policy to pretend that there are no divisions .  i may agree with the gentleman 's view about a timetable .  that is not the issue .  the issue is that the last discussion of iraq in this body will show division , bitterness and divisiveness , and that could have been avoided with a little bit of flexibility and consideration on the part of the majority for the views of almost one-half of this body .
