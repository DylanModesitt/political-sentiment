mr. chairman , i yield myself as much time as i may consume .  mr. chairman , i agree with a great deal of what the gentleman from ohio ( mr. oxley )  has said , as i agree with a great deal of what is in the bill .  in the nature of parliamentary debate , we will be focusing on some specific points where i disagree , but i do not want that to obscure the fact that there is a great deal of agreement .
