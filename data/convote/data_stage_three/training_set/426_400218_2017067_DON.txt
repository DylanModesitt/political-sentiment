mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute to respond quickly , just to clarify a couple of facts .  mr. speaker , i have all of the respect and admiration for the chair of our committee , but a closer reading of the substitute bill would not , in fact , require a federal-run program ; rather the department of labor would contract out the state-licensed health insurance plans in order to administer these programs .  but we do feel that there is a requirement or a necessity to offer greater incentives and inducements for small businesses to offer this coverage .  that is why we are offering a premium support program with it .
