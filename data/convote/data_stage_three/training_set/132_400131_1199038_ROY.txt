mr. chairman , i thank the chairman for yielding me this time .  we appreciate the chairman and the committee 's hard work on this bill .  i want to specifically highlight the rose bay ecosystem project in florida 's 24th congressional district , which i represent .  here local , county , and state agencies have worked for 10 years now and have spent more than $ 30 million to restore our natural aquatic ecosystem of rose bay .  now this project has stalled , understandably , due to limited funds at a time of war .  in the 1940s , rose bay was a productive estuary and shellfish harvesting area on the halifax river in volusia county .  since the 1990s , local engineers and cities have anted up to their responsibility , and we would hope that the army corps of engineers would live up to the agreed-upon 5-point plan to restore rose bay .  i would ask the chairman 's help , along with the committee 's , to do everything we can to get this project back on the appropriate steps forward .
