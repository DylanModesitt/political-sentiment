mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  i want to speak from love and compassion , not just the law , and embrace the strongest pro-family position as we move in this debate .  the schiavo and schindler families need our prayers to do for terry what not a single one of us wishes to imagine , to make a decision on the life of a beloved as they traverse the jagged edge of being .  terri 's family , all of them , love her .  she is not alone .  but her being belongs not to us but to god and to them .  all of us are mere bystanders , the speaker , abc news , jeb bush , and every single one of us .  only terri 's family has walked the profound journey of accompaniment with her for the last 15 years , and it has been a long suffering one .  of one thing i am certain .  this decision on terri does not belong in this congress .  in fact , it does not even belong in the courts .  it lies with the family , those closest to her , even when that family is divided , bitter , exhausted , and unable to reconcile .
