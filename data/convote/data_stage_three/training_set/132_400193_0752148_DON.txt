madam chairman , the gentleman from alaska ( mr. young )  asked a very important question : where are the technologies that we can use to avoid having to destroy the character of one of our most pristine areas in america ?  and the answer is that we have technologies today that we simply stopped using 20 years ago .  if you look at this graph , it shows the mileage of our cars that we have .  you see , starting in 1975 it went up dramatically because we had a bipartisan consensus to demand to use existing technologies to improve our automobile efficiency .  it went up dramatically , almost doubling , almost doubling by 1985 .  and then what happened ?  we fell off the wagon , and since that time , our average full economy shown by this middle line has absolutely , absolutely gone down since 1985 .  the fact of the matter is , these are not future techno dreams that someone has dreamed up in their garage somewhere ; they are technologies that exist today .  i drive a car that gets 44 miles to the gallon .  i am 62 '' , 200 pounds ; it is totally safe and comfortable .  we need to get back on the fuel efficiency wagon as we were in the 1980s on a bipartisan basis and not put a mustache on the mona lisa .  you say 2 , 000 acres ?  it is still a mustache on the mona lisa for our most pristine areas .
