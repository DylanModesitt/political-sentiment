mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  this is a vigorous debate about the priorities that are embodied in our budget blueprint .  but for the second day in a row now , we have had this characterized as a government without a conscience .  yet since 1995 , we have seen dramatic and historic increases to idea , individuals with disabilities education act .  title i , historically high numbers .  veterans health care , $ 18.9 billion in fiscal year 2000 , $ 30 billion today .  education numbers , up in double digits .  hhs and nih , doubled .  that is not a government without a conscience .  that is a government that has seen unsustainable rates of increases to discretionary domestic spending .  this budget turns that corner and begins the process of slowing the growth in mandatory and discretionary but continuing to provide for those priorities , continuing to make those tough decisions in ways that have been avoided by prior congresses .  mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
