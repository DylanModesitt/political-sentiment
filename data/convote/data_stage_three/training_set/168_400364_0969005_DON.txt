madam chairman , i yield myself 1 minute just to say , first of all , that my distinguished colleague from virginia and i will be working together later this week if they try to close any military bases .  but on this bill we , unfortunately , have to disagree .  first of all , madam chairman , murder , rape , kidnapping are already illegal in every state .  interstate gang members can be caught by rico and organized crime , continuing criminal enterprise , fbi is already working on that .  but this bill contains a provision that fist fights can subject young people to 10-year mandatory minimums .  the after-school programs that have been disparaged are the kinds of things that will actually reduce gang involvement .  you can disparage them by calling it arts and crafts for gang members .  but if you ask the researchers what will actually make a difference , it is those after-school programs to give the kids constructive things to do with their time .
