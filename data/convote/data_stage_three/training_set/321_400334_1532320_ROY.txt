mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i thank the gentleman for his comments .  and i do agree that funding gifted and talented education in this country is an important mission .  we must continue to provide support for our brightest students to succeed , especially in the areas of math and science .  i hope the gentleman understands that with such a tough budget allocation , we did not have the resources to support everything we would have liked to have done , including some important and successful programs like the javits program for gifted and talented students .  i will work with the gentleman from illinois to address this issue in conference .
