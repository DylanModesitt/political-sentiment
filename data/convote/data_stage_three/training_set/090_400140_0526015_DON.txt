mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute .  the gentleman from wisconsin in an effort to find an inconsistency quoted me as being for habeas corpus so people can have their day in court .  i am .  i do not ever remember supporting a bill in congress where we decided person by person who got the right of habeas corpus and who did not .  my argument is a separation-of-powers argument .  yes , i believe a general right to go to court when you have claimed there has been an error in your criminal procedure makes sense , but we are not talking about that here .  we are talking about , despite his claim that this is not a private bill , a private bill , a bill that names one individual and allows this individual to do it .
