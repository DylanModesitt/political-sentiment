mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for asking .  the impetus behind this is , these are aliens who have been ordered deported by a federal judge as a result of a hearing , who do not show up .  they have had their day in court .  the process is through .  they have been ordered deported , and only 13 percent actually are deported .
