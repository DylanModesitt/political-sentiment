mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  the prior speaker said we have fixed it .  well , if it is fixed , why are the airlines not included in the legislation ?  i have been on the floor of the house ever since i came here .  my daddy worked for united for 40 years .  my sister worked for united for 25 years .  my brother-in-law worked for united for 27 years .  my niece works for united right now .  if we are so concerned about them , why is it not in the legislation ?  secondly , if we fixed it , why is it unclear what happens with cash balance plans that are already in place and the irs has not given them a decision ?  we go prospectively , but we do not go retroactively .  in the city of cleveland , there are four companies that went into a cash balance plan , and cash balance plans are the wave of the future .  people want portability .  they are not going to work for united , like my dad , for 40 years .  they are going to work one place 7 years .  they are going to work somewhere else 7 years , and they need to move their money around .  it is the wave of the future , and we have not fixed cash balance plans .  and i encourage my colleagues to fix it .  if they are saying we fixed it , fix it right now .  i want to encourage mr. boehner , mr. thomas , mr. camp  and everyone else : do not tell us we are going to fix it in conference .  put it in the bill .  i would like to see it in writing .  i want to see it in red , black , blue , brown , whatever color you want to give it to me .  our promises are idle if it is not in writing .  i want this legislation to work for americans because people do deserve certainty .  they deserve certainty .  employers who went into a plan , they even paid up for their employees to deal with the issue of wear-away , and they can not get clarity on the programs that they have in place right now .  help them .  fix it .
