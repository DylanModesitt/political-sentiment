mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman yielding .  everyone is working as hard as they can .  as the gentleman knows , this bill has taken a long time to work out the differences between the house and the senate .  we get very close every time we reach the deadline of an expiration date .  the expiration date is set on wednesday .  everybody is going to be working over the weekend , and we are working as hard as we can with the goal to bring that conference report to the floor before the expiration of the short-term funding measure .
