mr. chairman , the material that is on page 20 relates to a clarification of the ban on possession of hand guns by juveniles .  it appears to me that the clarification does not clarify the statute .  the best thing to do is to completely remove the clarification as was proposed , thus leaving the current law intact , which means that if a juvenile possesses a hand gun , he will have to have a written note stating that he is authorized to do so from his parent .
