mr. speaker , imagine if we could bring a piece of legislation to the floor of this house that would , over the next 30-month period of time , result in benefits that every american could share in .  things like increasing business investments by 25 percent , growing the value of the stock market by over $ 4 trillion .  creating 4.4 million new jobs .  reducing the unemployment from 6.3 to 5 percent .  having quarterly gdp grow at an average of 4.1 percent .  increase tax receipts by $ 274 billion over a 12-month period of time , a 15 percent increase , the largest in 25 years .  and decrease the deficit over that same 12-month period of time by over $ 100 billion .  mr. speaker , it would be hard to imagine that we would not all support that , but i guess it is not hard to imagine , given the conversation here today , but that is exactly what this body did when we passed tax relief in 2003 .  and today we are simply extending these pro-growth tax policies that have led to this historic economic growth .  i think , mr. speaker , we all understand the benefit of hindsight and history is full of valuable lessons .  i encourage my colleagues to use the benefits of hindsight and the facts of history to support this tax relief extension today and the policies that led undeniably to opportunities of growth and prosperity for every single american .  because not to do so , mr. speaker , is the thing that would be truly hard to imagine .
