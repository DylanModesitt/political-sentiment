mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i thank my colleague from texas for his comments .  i think i can start out by saying that we come from a state that is very diligent and as well very astute on their members of congress supporting unfunded mandates to a burdened and already overworked state budget in a growing state that would have added responsibilities with this enormous burden that this real id bill would exercise against it .  let me just say to the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions )  , because i know his commitment to fiscal responsibility , let me refer him back to the cbo report of 2004 .  we appreciate the cbo , but we know what happened ; and i think it is more important to know what the impact will be on the states on the basis of the national governors association and state legislatures .  in 2004 , on this very same bill , the cbo told what the numbers would be .  it was not under $ 62 million .  in fact , it was mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .
