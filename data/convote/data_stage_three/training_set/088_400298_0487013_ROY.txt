mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds .  just to punctuate what the gentleman from ohio and the gentlewoman from connecticut said , we believe in local control ; and we want to be partners with these communities in solving problems .  we disagreed with the president in his budget with the changes that were made to the community development block grant ; so we made that value judgment and change in this budget .  we are supporting our mayors .  we are supporting our communities .  we want to be good partners , and we believe in local control in solving those problems .  the big federal government can not solve all these problems that these local folks are dealing with .  we want to give them the opportunity to do that .
