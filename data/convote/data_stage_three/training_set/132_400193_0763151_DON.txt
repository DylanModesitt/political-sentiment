mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i appreciate the comments of the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton )  .  we can not measure contribution by number , we have to measure by weight .  however , mr. chairman , i think you are still going to win the debate .  by the way , i am a new member of the commerce committee .  i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton )  , the chairman , for the very fair-minded way that he handled this in committee , in giving both sides an adequate degree of leeway to argue their positions .  we all appreciate his leadership .
