mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. chairman , before yielding , let me commend the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher )  for his powerful statement .  and let me commend the gentleman from illinois ( chairman hyde ) for including in his bill extremely important measures that enhance accountability .  i would like to state that the lantos-shays substitute which we will present later contains the same measures .  we are in full accord on dramatically enhancing accountability at the united nations .
