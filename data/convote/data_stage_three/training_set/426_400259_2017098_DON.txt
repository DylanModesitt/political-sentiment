mr. speaker , i rise to support the motion to recommit because ahps are awful health plans .  ahps roll back state benefit standards that protect women and children .  they are awful for women ; they are awful for children .  our motion protects americans who have access to mental health benefits .  it protects families ' access to maternity care and well-baby checks .  maternity coverage is critical for women .  it should not be optional .  fortunately , many states require health plans to cover maternity care and well-baby checks for their children .  the bottom line is healthy moms equal healthy children .  healthy children , valuing children 's lives , should be a goal we all share .  children deserve a healthy start in life with regular visits to the doctor and necessary immunizations .  preventive care makes economic sense .  it can prevent avoidable illness and reduce future health care costs .  i encourage all members to reject awful health plans and to support the motion to recommit .
