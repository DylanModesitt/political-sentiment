mr. speaker , i am transmitting a status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2005 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 .  this report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the congressional budget act and section 401 of the conference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 ( s. con .  res. 95 , which is currently in effect as a concurrent resolution on the budget in the house under h. res. 5 ) .  this status report is current through january 21 , 2005 .  the term `` current level '' refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the president 's signature .  the first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority , outlays , and revenues with the aggregate levels set forth by s. con .  res. 95 .  this comparison is needed to enforce section 311 ( a ) of the budget act , which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the budget resolution 's aggregate levels .  the table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2005 because appropriations for those years have not yet been considered .  the second table compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for discretionary action by each authorizing committee with the `` section 302 ( a ) '' allocations made under s. con .  res. 95 for fiscal year 2005 and fiscal years 2005 through 2009 .  `` discretionary action '' refers to legislation enacted after the adoption of the budget resolution .  this comparison is needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act , which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302 ( a ) discretionary action allocation of new budget authority for the committee that reported the measure .  it is also needed to implement section 311 ( b ) , which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311 ( a ) .  the third table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2005 with the `` section 302 ( b ) '' suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among appropriations subcommittees .  the comparison is also needed to enforce section 302 ( f ) of the budget act because the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302 ( b ) suballocation .  the fourth table gives the current level for 2006 of accounts for advance appropriations under section 401 s. con .  res. 95 .  this list is needed to enforce section 401 of the budget resolution , which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that are : ( i ) not identified in the statement of managers or ( ii ) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution .  enactment of measures providing new budget authority for fiscal year 2005 in excess of $ 46 , 377 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause fiscal year 2005 budget authority to exceed the appropriate level set by s. con .  res. 95 enactment of measures providing new outlays for fiscal year 2005 in excess of $ 21 , 374 , 000 , 000 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause fiscal year 2005 outlays to exceed the appropriate level set by s. con .  res. 95 .  enactment of measures that would reduce revenue for fiscal year 2005 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause revenues to fall further below the appropriate level set by s. con .  res. 95 .  enactment of measures resulting in revenue reduction for the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 ( if not already included in the current level estimate ) would cause revenues to fall further below the appropriate levels set by s. con .  res. 95 .  appropriate level & lt ;
