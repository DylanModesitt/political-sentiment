madam chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i briefly would like to respond to both of my good friends .  we are not offering a resolution .  our legislation is identical to the republican legislation .  the only difference is that your punitive provision is automatic ; our punitive provision provides discretion to the secretary of state to implement it or not .  so please do not talk about resolutions .  we are not talking about toothless resolutions .  our legislation is as binding as the republican legislation is .  we just do not put it on autopilot .  the guillotine does not fall automatically ; it is put in the hands of a singularly intelligent secretary of state .  with respect to the long list of items that my good friend , the gentleman from new jersey , outlined , every single one of them is part of our legislation .  every single one of them is part of our legislation .  the only difference is that the republican proposal , looking years ahead into the future , automatically mandates a 50 percent cut in funding if only one of 46 goals is not achieved .  our legislation allows the secretary of state to implement that provision as she sees fit .  madam chairman , i reserve the balance of my time .
