madam chairman , as i rise to the podium here , i want to bring up a poster which shows what this arctic national wildlife area really is .  first of all , let me say that the arctic national wildlife refuge is 19.5 million acres of alaska , set aside in 1960 .  also in 1960 , they set aside 1.5 million acres for exploration for oil .  that is called the area 1002 part of anwr .  this is area 1002 .  this is the area we are going to be drilling on for oil and gas .  as you can see , no big trees , no big mountains , no big herds of anything .  it is just frozen tundra out there .  but the 1002 area will continue to provide , as the usgs has already said , an estimated oil reservoir for this country that will equal the amount of oil we will get from saudi arabia for 30 years , madam chairman ; 10.4 billion barrels would make it the largest oil reserve find in the world since the nearby prudhoe bay discovery was done 30 years ago .  madam chairman , the area 1002 is not a wilderness .  it is part of anwr set aside 18 years ago for oil and gas exploration .  this is where this 2 , 000-acre surface disturbance is going to take place .  we are not talking about a pristine wilderness area that one would find in any of the southern 48 contiguous states that have forests .  so with that , madam chairman , i just wanted to bring to the members ' attention that this is not the pristine wilderness that most people have in mind .  this is a frozen tundra that we are going to disturb only 2 , 000 acres of it , and from there we are going to provide this country with nearly 10 billion barrels of new oil to meet the needs of this country 's energy demands .
