mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , i do understand that not everybody is in agreement about what we are doing today , but for the members that are paying attention , the 9/11 terrorist travel report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states , known as the 9/11 commission , said on page 43 , and i would like to quote this : `` september 11 : as the hijackers boarded four flights , american airlines flights 11 and 77 , and united airlines flights 93 and 175 , at least six hijackers used u.s. identification documents obtained and acquired in the previous months , three of which were fraudulently obtained in northern virginia. '' mr. speaker , we would have to really not respect this 9/11 commission if we were not going to follow up on the work that they did .  that is why we are here today .  we are here for the best reason , for the security of this great nation and the wonderful people who care and entrust upon the united states congress the ability to make sure we do all that we can to avoid attacks in the future .
