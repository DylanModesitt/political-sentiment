madam speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding .  what about the amount-in-controversy component , the $ 5 million ?  under current law , some federal courts have determined the value for requests for injunctive relief by considering the value to each individual plaintiff .  since that value is usually less than $ 75 , 000 , these courts have kept such cases in state court .  this is sometimes known as the plaintiff 's viewpoint , defendant 's viewpoint problem .  would the chairman explain how the bill resolves this challenge ?
