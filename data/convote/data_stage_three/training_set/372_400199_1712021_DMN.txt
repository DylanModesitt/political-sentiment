mr. speaker , i rise today to speak in opposition to h.r. 740 , a bill to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 by expanding the size of the commission that hears osha appeals from three to five members .  supporters of the measure argue that the panel has had difficulty meeting a quorum because of recusals and vacancies .  however , i would argue that the change would allow the current administration to stack the board with pro-business members .  many responsible employers are tired of continually being underbid by unscrupulous and reckless operators that refuse to spend anything on protecting workers ' lives or promoting public safety .  voting in favor of h.r. 740 , could potentially erode a basic respect for human life .  we must remember that workers killed on the job are someone 's son or daughter , husband or wife , and/or father or mother .  unlike other victims of crime , their lives are often seen as expendable .  as a mexican consular officer said : `` too many employers do n't see these people as human beings. '' bereaved family members suffer further upon discovery that federal law denies them justice .  if h.r. 740 is allowed to pass , we would be allowing the current administration to stack the board with pro-business members .  i urge my colleagues to oppose the passage of h.r. 740 .
