mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition of this bill .  it does nothing to make america safer .  it is simply anti-immigrant legislation placed under the mask of homeland security .  the bill will prevent states from giving licenses to undocumented immigrants .  it will not prevent terrorists from obtaining identification forms .  all of the 9/11 hijackers were in this country legally .  in fact , allowing immigrants to have licenses actually improves homeland security by allowing our government to track who is in our borders .  this bill will also raise insurmountable hurdles for refugees seeking asylum and will deport victims of persecution into the hands of their persecutors .  proponents of this provision claim that we need to tighten asylum laws , yet , they can not pinpoint a single terrorist given asylum in the united states .  this bill will also require the completion of a fence on the mexican border , waiving environmental laws in california .  this fence is a complete waste of money and resources .  people will go over it , under it and around it to enter our country .  our immigration system is a broken system that needs to be fixed .  we need reform that provides hardworking people of good character with a real path towards citizenship .  but this bill is simply a band-aid on the problem that will not provide lasting reform .
