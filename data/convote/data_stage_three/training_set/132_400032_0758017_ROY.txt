mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman for her comments .  as we continue with our debate , as we were saying earlier , we will be looking at electricity , and we are going to have some provisions in this bill that the federal government is going to lead on energy conservation issues .  one of our colleagues talked earlier about clean coal technology and renewable sources .  those will be addressed in the bill also .  and we will look forward tomorrow as we come to the floor to being able to continue our discussion and to draw attention to these issues .
