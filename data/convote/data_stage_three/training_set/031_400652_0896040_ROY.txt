mr. speaker , i congratulate the chairman on this bill .  it is important that we take care of business with our military .  mr. speaker , having been to iraq this year , i saw our troops , our young men and women from all branches of the service doing the finest job ever representing the concept of freedom and representing the united states ; and they certainly need the supplemental .  however , i am concerned about some of the baggage that seems to have been added to the supplemental .  and i think maybe in the future we should be careful about adding things that are not really important emergencies , such as in this supplemental conferring eligibility for rural housing assistance grants in the village of new miami , ohio ; allowing some farm service accounts for the alaska dairy farmers ; increasing the cost of the fort peck fish hatchery project in minnesota ; and adding to the national center for manufacturing services in michigan ; along with $ 500 , 000 for the oral history of negotiated settlement projects at the university of nevada .  i think these belong in some other bill .  they may be great projects , but they certainly are not emergency projects .  but i do urge all members of the house to support this legislation .
