mr. speaker , before yielding to my good friend from massachusetts , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i would say to my colleague from texas ( mr. gohmert )  i have not had an opportunity to talk to him , and i simply want to point out to him that all of us that have feelings regarding states ' rights line up in many respects alike .  but the gentleman needs to know that the national governors association and the american association of motor vehicle administrators , the national conference of state legislators all oppose this legislation .  and the primary reason that they do would be , had i known the gentleman 20 years ago , or 10 years ago , he would have been arguing that the federal government is sending unfunded mandates to the states .  well , welcome to the federal government .  this is an unfunded mandate .
