i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  mr. chairman , i love henry hyde .  i have awesome respect for tom lantos .  i thank the gentleman from california for supporting the president in the war against iraq and to go into afghanistan .  i thank him for being such a clear thinker along with the gentleman from illinois on so many issues .  we are not part of the kyoto agreement .  we are not part of the land mine agreement .  we are not part of other treaties .  we are not part of the icc , the international criminal court .  i understand those things .  we are in a war in afghanistan , a war in iraq , and we are telling the president of the united states and the secretary of state , forget it .  we do n't care what you think .  we 're going ahead .  mandatory , nuclear option .  it is going to happen even if the u.n .  does most of what we ask .  even if they do 80 percent of what we ask , it is still going to happen .  mandatory .  i can not believe when our men and women are fighting in iraq that we would move forward with legislation like this when we need to draw countries together .  the problem is not all the reforms can physically happen , and some of them will not happen , and some in the u.n .  might not even want them to happen .  they are eager to have us withhold funds .  they are eager to have more people hate the united states .  the united states , the president , the secretary of state , they are working so hard , and they are making progress .  we have a new manager , chris burnham , who is the under secretary running the whole management of the u.n .  we are making progress .  go with the hyde bill , but with the flexibility to let our president and our secretary of state have the ability to work with these countries to move them along and see progress .
