mr. speaker , i rise today speak in opposition to h.r. 741 , a bill to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 by requiring judges in osha appeals cases to give more weight to the commission 's decisions than to labor department regulators .  supporters argue the legislation would codify the intent of the 1970 occupational safety and health act ( pl 91-596 ) .  however , i would argue that the measure would violate a 1991 supreme court ruling that gave the labor department priority in interpreting osha regulations .  nearly every working man and woman in the nation comes under osha 's jurisdiction ( with some exceptions such as miners , transportation workers , many public employees , and the self-employed ) .  users and recipients of osha services include : occupational safety and health professionals , the academic community , lawyers , journalists , and personnel of other government entities .  to ensure that these individuals are safe and protected on the job , osha and its state partners have approximately 2 , 100 inspectors , including complaint discrimination investigators , engineers , physicians , educators , standards writers , and other technical and support personnel spread over more than 200 offices throughout the country .  this staff establishes protective standards , enforces those i urge my colleagues to oppose h.r. 741 .
