madam speaker , i want to respond to my friend from florida that the language that substitutes for debate around here is troublesome .  demagogic , i heard the gentleman say .  immoral , gun-boat diplomacy , contempt for the u.n .  none of those inflammatory terms , in my judgment , apply to this debate .  and i suggest that we can disagree as to the one issue , and that is how to enforce the reforms we all agree are needed , without calling each other names or disparaging our motives .
