mr. speaker , i thank the whip for the information .  it may be helpful to know that i believe on our side of the aisle , we believe that the gentleman from michigan ( mr. hoekstra )  and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman 's ) agreement was appropriate in the sense that the flexibility be given to the national intelligence director to provide for the best possible personnel assignment with reference to maintaining our security and intelligence apparatus in the most effective mode would be correct , if that is of any help to the whip as he considers the support that that proposition may have on the floor .  i realize there are those on his side of the aisle who have some concerns about it .  i understand that the secretary of defense may have some concern about it .  but i think , frankly , i would hope that a very substantial majority of the house would agree both with the republican chairman of the intelligence committee and the democratic ranking member of the intelligence committee .  the gentleman does not have to comment on that , but i thought that it might be useful information for him .
