mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , just to make a couple of gentle points , the effort has been , at least on the record , as not , i do not want to say fighting against injustice , but a record of fighting against justice , particularly in the case of the effort to free mumia abu-jamal .  i think most of us know about that particular case .  and i am concerned about a role model .  i am concerned about young people a generation or two from now .  when they go back by that post office in berkeley and look at the name on the post office , they are going to ask what were the principles that brought this about ?  and i contend that those principles would be running contrary to american values .
