mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  the gentleman from virginia who just spoke is a brilliant lawyer , and i know he is not missing any points ; but i want to say it is very important that the rest of our colleagues understand , we know that all of these crimes mentioned here today are illegal .  but the point is , this bill addresses the dismantling of the systems that support gangs , and i think it is very important that we keep that in mind .
