mr. speaker , i will be happy to respond to the gentleman .  let me say we are in the midst of a discussion about ethics at this point .  obviously , it is our goal to maintain the highest ethical standards .  we have a law , which is actually a criminal law , which states that it is a violation of 18 u.s. code 607 for the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property .  the idea behind this change that is included in this rules package is that members should not be required to carry two separate cell phones with them .  this would allow campaign funds to be used for the purchase of a cell phone that might be used for calling your office or other official purposes .  but the law which prevents the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property in fact is maintained and is one we that feel very strongly about .
