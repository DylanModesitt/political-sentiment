mr. speaker , continuing my support for an overwhelming majority of free trade agreements , i cast my vote in favor the u.s.-bahrain free trade agreement ( fta ) .  in the past i have expressed serious concerns over copyright provisions contained in some free trade agreements negotiated by the bush administration that arguably constrain the ability of the united states to modernize our laws to reflect the realities of technology .  i have been repeatedly reassured that notwithstanding these copyright provisions , the united states would still be able to modernize our copyright laws .  i am also pleased that in other areas of the u.s.-bahrain fta , the president finally followed democratic recommendations to ensure the adoption and enforcement of internationally-recognized basic standards for the people of bahrain .
