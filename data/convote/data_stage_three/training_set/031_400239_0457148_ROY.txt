mr. chairman , i would simply say it is our intention to pursue the questions the gentlewoman is asking .  it may very well be in conference on the supplemental that it is appropriate , but frankly in some ways we take from peter to pay paul .  we can pursue this is regular order , and i prefer to use the supplemental process for those emergencies that we can not deal with in regular order .  because of that , i am not pursuing the recommendations at this time .  we will follow through , however , on the questions that the gentlewoman is asking .  mr. chairman , i insist on my point of order .
