mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this resolution .  it may seem peculiar , but , frankly , i think that the military does not need this resolution .  it is not broken out there .  they are having the ability to recruit .  even despite the negative news from iraq , the recruitment numbers are up for all the services .  what this resolution does is sort of breaks this feeling in america that democracy allows divergence of opinion and that the people that own the real estate should have a voice in who can visit that real estate .  we do not have any nationally owned universities , yet this resolution requires equal access for all military recruiters at institutions of higher education .  i think we are getting into a really slippery area here because you are going to create within those campuses huge debates that students are going to say , we do n't like this stuff being jammed down our throats .  we and the faculty and the trustees of a university ought to be able to decide who can visit our campus , as they do in all other things .  for example , here in washington , d.c. , catholic university does not allow pro-abortionist recruiters to come and talk on the campus , and here you are going to require , regardless of what the issue should be , that military recruiters have to be allowed on campus .  i think it is a very slippery slope .  i do not think we need to go there , because the recruitment numbers are not down .  i think the military has historically stood on its own feet to do very well in recruiting without getting congress involved mandating that they have to be on campuses .  i think you are going to have a negative reaction .  i would urge congress very carefully to think about this and to vote `` no '' until we get a better thought on how we want to mandate democracy in this country .
