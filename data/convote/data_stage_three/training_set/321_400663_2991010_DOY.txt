mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , this country is at a critical crossroads in terms of deciding what it stands for , what its priorities are .  our priorities should be to make decisions based on shared sacrifice and a long-term view that seeks to fight for the least powerful among us .  unfortunately , this rule would allow legislation with a shortsighted approach to come to the floor .  all of us , democrats and republicans , hope that medical science will provide the breakthrough to provide relief from a disease which will ease a family member 's suffering .  we all worry about whether rising energy costs will force seniors to make life-and-death decisions about where to spend their limited resources .  and yet this conference report ignores those very needs .  it narrowly restricts the future of all americans so that a very few might have a bit more of a tax break .  that is an approach that i hope all members will reject .
