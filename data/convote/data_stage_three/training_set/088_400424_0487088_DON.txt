mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from south carolina ( mr. spratt )  and the gentleman from iowa ( chairman nussle ) for providing the congressional black caucus a little extra time to talk about the cbc budget , and i want to summarize what our proposed budget which we will be introducing tomorrow will do .  it will roll back the tax cuts on people with adjusted gross incomes that exceed $ 200 , 000 per year .  most of the revenue raised in the cbc budget will be used to address disparities in america 's communities .  a substantial portion is reserved to reduce the deficit .  on the military side , we would roll back $ 7.8 billion in ballistic missile defense spending leaving using $ 1 billion for research to continue regarding the ballistic missile defense system .  all of these funds are spent on other defense items to support our troops , homeland security needs , and veterans program and benefits .  the total for defense , homeland security , and veterans is equal to the republican budget .  the bottom line is that the cbc budget addresses critical domestic challenges and supports our troops .  the cbc budget reduces the deficit by $ 167 billion compared to the house majority 's budget over the next 5 years .  this fiscal responsibility is rewarded by a reduction of $ 27 billion in interest payments , compared to the house majority 's budget over that 5-year period .  we will have a responsible budget , and i look forward to having the support of our colleagues in this body and look forward to discussing the proposed cbc budget in more detail tomorrow when our substitute is presented to the house .
