mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  in closing , i would just say that we have heard some discussion today about policies of the united states armed forces for a long time .  since its inception , there have been special policies applied to our military , the ability to impose nonjudicial punishment , the ability to restrict entry by those who are too tall or too short , the ability to order its members away from home and into combat and into harm 's way .  but the discussion today is not about those policies and should not be about those policies .  the discussion today is about keeping our military , keeping our armed forces , the best trained , the best led , the best equipped in the world ; and that means we need the ability to recruit the best and the brightest .  this is about insisting that our military recruiters have equal access to america 's universities and colleges .  i urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution .
