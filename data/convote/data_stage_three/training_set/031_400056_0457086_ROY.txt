i thought what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey )  did by making a performance of duty was a wise thing .  i think that was a wise move of the gentleman .  i do not know why the gentleman would be upset with regard to my remarks on performance of duty because what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey )  did is followed what we , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. evans )  and i , had also recommended .  performance of duty is a good thing .
