mr. chairman , today 's bill would not be nearly as flawed or controversial if it had the benefit of going through the committee process .  unfortunately , we are faced with costly legislation that overturns states rights and does little to address the problems of our immigration system or to protect americans from another terrorist attack .  instead , this bill places enormous regulatory and financial burdens on state governments and makes department of motor vehicles ( dmv ) employees de facto immigration officers .  this policy promises to be ineffective as there are approximately 70 different kinds of immigration related documents issued by the federal government .  this bill will not deter illegal immigration ; it will probably mean illegal immigrants will drive without licenses .  in addition , in order to complete three miles of a border fence near san diego , section 102 of this bill suspends all laws , from public health and labor to the environment and property compensation .  in fact , all barriers and roads along 7 , 514 miles of u.s. borders would be exempt from all laws .  one person in the department of homeland security would be above the law without any judicial appeal or remedy .  this is unprecedented .  some of the environmental laws waived would include the noise control act , the clean water act , the farmland protection policy act , and the bald eagle act .  in addition to being bad public policy , this exemption is unnecessary , as most of these laws have security exemptions already written into them .  this legislation will not make us safer or reduce illegal immigration .  in the end , it is hard to imagine a more dangerous precedent .
