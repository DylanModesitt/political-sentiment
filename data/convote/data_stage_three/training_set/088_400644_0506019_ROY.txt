mr. chairman , i think i may have a chart on that .  payroll jobs have rebounded because of tax cuts .  with a weakness of the economy going into the bush administration from the clinton years and with the advent of 9/11 , we had a weakening of the economy .  but once the tax cuts took hold , we have rebounded .  we have got over 3 million jobs because of this .  beyond that , there has been reference to the fact that tax cuts have created the deficit .  that is not true .  actually , that is borne out with statistical proof here .  the largest cause of deficits between 2001 and 2004 was the economy .  and the best way to address the economy and get the economy to rebound is by cutting taxes , spurring growth , reducing regulations , empowering small businesses and businesses all across the country to create more jobs , to increase earnings .  so what we see here , the largest cause , 49 percent of the cause of the deficit , was the economy .  and because of that , we have been able to rebound .  because of the tax cuts and because of the rebound in the economy , we are reducing the deficit .  we are taking on this , and we are going to further cut taxes in order to keep spurring the economy .
