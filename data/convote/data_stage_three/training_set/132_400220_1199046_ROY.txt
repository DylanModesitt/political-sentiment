mr. chairman , i rise today to urge funding to redraw the flood plain maps that would assist in addressing flood plan management problems along the missouri river .  the states of iowa , nebraska , south dakota , and missouri , as well as all cities and counties bordering the river , have an immediate need for improved flood plain information along the missouri river .  the lack of incomplete data hampers the way that communities plan for their economic future and interact with state and federal agencies .  the existing data is approximately 30 years old .  coupled with that , is the fact that the recently completed upper mississippi river system flow frequency study , which includes the main-lower missouri below gavins point dam , resulted in significant this need for new information is due to the changes in land use and the pressure from development occurring all along the river .  improving the flood plain mapping , which meets the requirements of the nfip ( authorized by p.l .  86-645 ) , can be developed working from the results of the upper mississippi river system flow frequency study .  the new flood plain information will allow development of water surface profiles and digital flood insurance rate maps ( dfirm ) for regulating current and future development of the 100-year and 500-year flood plains as well as the floodway along this 313-mile reach of the river .
