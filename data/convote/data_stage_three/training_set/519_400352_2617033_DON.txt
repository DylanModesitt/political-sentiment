mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , the decisions that we need to make have to be focused on what is best for the country , not what is best for one 's political party ; and i think that has really been the problem .  it seems to me that every decision that is made down here by the republican majority is what is best for the republican party , not what is best for the country .  and it is time we start choosing the country over the party if we want to have some success .  and just go through everything that has happened .  everything that has happened with the majority leader has been an attempt to secure power for the party and not do its best for the country .  let us look at the cia leak and the corruption that is going on .  to out a cia agent because their husband disagreed with them on the war is choosing their party and protecting their party over what is best for the country .  and to make cuts in programs that would invest in the american people and lead to economic growth instead of listening to cal thomas , who says cut for the richest people who are getting corporate welfare , they do that because they could then raise money for their party .  and if the republican majority keeps choosing their party over the country , then the country becomes weak ; and a strong america starts right here at home .
