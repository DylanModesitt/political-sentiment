mr. chairman , i can not support the president 's request to spend billions more for this protracted war in iraq .  it 's time to bring our troops home .  next week we will commemorate the second anniversary of the war and u.s. occupation .  over 1 , 500 american lives have been lost along with countless numbers of iraqi civilians .  over 11 , 000 americans have been wounded .  the world is still not a safer place .  what have we gained ?  i disagree with those who claim a vote for this bill is a vote to support our troops .  i stand behind these brave americans and believe they ought to have every resource to protect them .  how is it supporting our troops to keep them in harms way without a plan to win this war ?  how is it supporting our troops when we continue to allow the bush administration to spend hundreds of millions of dollars at will on no bid government contracts with no oversight ?  how is it supporting our troops when we do n't provide for mental health services for those troops traumatized in combat ?  for all of these reasons , i 'm voting `` no '' on the president 's $ 81.3 billion supplemental request .  it is time for a plan to bring our troops home , not give the president another blank check .
