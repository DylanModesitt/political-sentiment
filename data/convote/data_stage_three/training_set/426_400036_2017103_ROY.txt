mr. speaker , the most coveted health insurance available to americans is offered by big companies and unions .  all we are trying to do in the underlying bill is to give small employers the same opportunity to provide high-quality health insurance to their employees at competitive prices .  the motion to recommit would require every ahp to cover every mandate known to man , driving up the cost of those policies and making sure that no new employees would ever be covered by an ahp .  there are 45 million americans with no health insurance .  while this will not cover all 45 million americans , it will help some americans who have no access to health insurance today have access to high-quality , competitively priced health insurance .  you can have all the mandates in the world ; but if you do not have health insurance , you get no coverage at all .  no doctors ' visits .  no nothing .  it is a bad motion .  support the underlying bill .
