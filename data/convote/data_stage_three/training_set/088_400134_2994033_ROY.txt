mr. speaker , i too want to commend those who worked to get the earmarks out of the bill .  but i just wanted to point out that not all the earmarks are out of the bill .  in the bill , we have $ 1.25 million for the center for excellence in native hawaiian law at the university of hawaii , $ 1.2 million for the hawaiian department of education for school construction , $ 2 million to the mississippi band of choctaw indians for cultural and education funding , $ 5 million for america 's promise .  now these may well be good programs , but they should not be funded in this bill that says that all the earmarks are gone .  we also violated a house rule where we were naming two federal facilities after sitting members of congress .  the center for disease control headquarters is being renamed the arlen specter headquarters and emergency operations center .  we are renaming the communication center at the cfdc the thomas r. harkin global communications center .  we should not be doing this .  if we are getting rid of the earmarks , we ought to get rid of all of them .
