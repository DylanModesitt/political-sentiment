mr. speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees on the patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization bill .  this motion to instruct would take the most contentious provisions of this bill and sunset them in 4 years .  these provisions include section 215 , which allows officials to order the surrender of anything when relevant to a terror investigation , section 206 which allows secret wiretap orders without definition of who and where the tap will go , and the `` lone wolf '' provision which allows the government to surveil so called `` agents of a foreign power '' who act alone .  egregious law that robs the civil liberties of law abiding americans should be reviewed sooner than later , therefore i strongly support these sunset provisions proposed in this motion to instruct .  my constituents agree that the american people should not have to compromise their civil liberties in order to combat extremism .  the local governments of pacific grove , salinas , santa cruz , and watsonville , ca have all passed resolutions expressing their concerns with the anti-privacy and anti-liberty nature of the patriot act .  i also would like to note my disappointment that the fiscal year 2006 state-science-justice-commerce appropriations bill included one of the most invasive provisions of the patriot act that permits sweeping searches and seizures of library and bookstore patron records , despite this body 's condemnation of the provision earlier this year .  voices in the congress echo voices of people across america .  i urge a `` yea '' vote on the motion to instruct .
