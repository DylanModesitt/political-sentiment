mr. chairman , i thank you for that kind offer and clarification .  let me just say that it has long been my position that we should not debate past decisions no the hudson river but look to the future in the region and focus on protecting those communities most directly affected by the cleanup project .  what has been consistently overlooked is the fact that dredging will have a heavy impact on people 's everyday lives .  this is especially true for the residents of fort edward , new york , who will be hosting the dewatering site in their community .  as the representative of that area , i want to continue to strive to uphold their interests and remind others that we are talking about real people and real neighborhoods , and not just political points for some special interest groups .  for that reason , i want to thank you for a separate report language provision which was inserted at my request to address the burden the hudson river cleanup project is placing on the people of fort edwards and reiterate my concern that the epa do all it can to provide assistance to the town .  it is my hope that we can jointly work towards that end and meet that important goal as the appropriation process continues .
