mr. speaker , i rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill , the u.s.-bahrain free trade agreement implementation act .  through cooperation -- democrats working alongside republicans on the ways and means committee , who then coordinated with the administration -- we have before us a strong trade package that will open markets , advance free trade and cement america 's ties to a strategically important ally in the middle east .  and with the changes that are coming to bahrain 's labor laws , this agreement will ensure that the fundamental rights of workers are protected .  it is my hope that in the future , these worker protections will be incorporated into the core of trade agreements , rather than through side agreements .  this is a standard to which the united states should hold all its trading partners .  though the magnitude of this particular trade pact is relatively small , the global trading system is at a critical juncture .  the united states ' leadership on trade is being tested -- here in congress and in geneva .  for that reason , i am pleased that today we have both parties working together to advance free and fair trade .  i hope that this agreement receives broad support and that july 's contentious and mean-spirited cafta debate is the low point , only to be seen in the rearview mirror .  because in the long term , the only way for america to continue to lead the world forward on trade is for us to work across the aisle here in the house .  i urge my colleagues to allow today 's debate to serve as a first step toward reviving the bipartisan consensus on trade policy that has served this congress so well in the past .
