i thank the gentleman for yielding .  madam chairman , over the past several months , the gentleman from texas and i have worked toward a fair and equitable solution to the problem of contamination caused by mtbe getting into our groundwater and other waters .  i appreciate all his efforts and the faith he has placed in me on this issue which is so critical to new hampshire , a state that has been affected significantly and , obviously , other affected states .  like him , i had hoped that we would be able to have our solution ready for today 's house consideration of the energy policy act .  however , i am not satisfied that what we have agreed upon in principle is sufficient to the problem or comprehensive enough to have my support , and i would rather not rush it simply for the sake of being done today .  does the gentleman agree that spending additional time will result in an improved product that will provide a mechanism to ensure that our drinking water is clean and safe today and into the future ?
