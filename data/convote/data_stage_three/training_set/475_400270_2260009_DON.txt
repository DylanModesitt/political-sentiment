mr. speaker , let me just say this in order to clarify the whole issue on subpoenas .  in section 5 it calls for joint operations , and it comes down to the majority party .  the majority , basically , the bottom line , are the only people that can actually subpoena .  so your statement was correct , the minority view on the committee or the democratic view on the committee , if we wanted a particular individual to be subpoenaed , could not be subpoenaed if we are not in the majority to be able to do so .
