mr. speaker , i thank the chairman of the committee on appropriations for yielding me this time .  the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha )  , the ranking member on our defense subcommittee , has explained the bill quite thoroughly as it relates to the war fighters .  the biggest part of this supplemental is for war fighters , and the bill that we have put together goes just to that issue .  the increases that we have added in this bill go to the urgently needed items such as ammunition , weapons , up-armored humvees , transport vehicles , jammers , night vision equipment , radios , add-on armor kits ; and the list goes on and on .  and i include a list of those items that are for the war fighter and force protection , mr. speaker .  the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha )  and the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) and i and many of our colleagues have visited our hospitals to visit with our soldiers and marines at walter reed and at bethesda naval hospital and also at landstuhl , where many of our servicemen come first before they get transported back to the united states , and we have located a number of areas where the government just does not take care of these soldiers and the marines .  and this bill goes a long way towards taking care of that .  it has been pretty generally known that we have in this bill increased the death benefit for those who make the total sacrifice and lose their lives in working and supporting the nation 's security .  we have also increased the service group life insurance programs substantially so that those who prefer to take part in that program can have additional benefits , and many of these benefits are really needed .  and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murtha )  referred to this , but i want to take just a minute and explain .  we added , basically , a new program , and that is for a traumatic injury insurance benefit for members of the service .  we provide up to $ 100 , 000 to compensate for injuries such as loss of sight , losing a hand or a foot , or other debilitating injuries .  and these benefits would be retroactive to october of 2001 , when the war started .  there are many soldiers and marines today who have been wounded so seriously that in previous wars would have died on the battlefield but who are living today in this war because of improved and increased medical benefits and better training and better medicines and the ability to transport from the battlefield to a medical facility .  so these soldiers and marines are hurt really bad , and we have an obligation to take care of them , and this bill goes a long way toward beginning that process , to take care of things for our heroes and our fallen heroes who have not been taken care of by the government properly .  the material previously referred to is as follows : conference agreement for additional equipment missile procurement , army : itas/tow mods 30 , 000 procurement of weapons and tracked combat vehicles , army : bradley reactive armor tiles 20 , 000 stryker 69 , 540 small arms modifications 55 , 200 procurement of ammunition , army : ammunition industrial base 57 , 800 other procurement , army : up-armored idmwvs ( m1114 ) 150 , 000 other hmmwvs ( m1151 ) 80 , 000 225 , 000 114 , 000 add-on armor kits 48 , 000 sincgars family 30 , 000 improved hf radios ( including prc-150 and prc-148 ) 17 , 000 jammers ( warlock including low cost jammer ) 60 , 000 night vision devices 59 , 000 counter rocket artillery and mortar system ( cram ) 75 , 000 force xxi battle command brigade and below ( fbcb2 ) 66 , 100 handheld stand-off mine detection system ( hstamids ) 10 , 000 & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; army total : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; 1 , 166 , 640 procurement of ammunition , navy and marine corps : small arms ammunition 6 , 000 procurement , marine corps : light armored vehicle ( lav ) 175 , 000 night vision equipment 54 , 000 radio systems ( including eplrs , prc-117 and hf communications vehicle ) 55 , 000 hmmwvs 30 , 000 & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; marine corps total : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; 320 , 000 grand total : 1 , 486 , 640 & lt ; p & gt ;
