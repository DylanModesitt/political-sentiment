mr. speaker , this is a good resolution , and i support it , and the issue is important .  however , i just wanted to stand tonight to point out the fact that we are really just talking about the tail .  this is not the dog ; it is simply the tail .  it is important .  i do not want to minimize it .  but the truth is we are talking a $ 16 billion sale most of which will go to american shareholders .  however , what we are not talking about is the elephant in the room where right now as of today , after 4 1/2 years of this administration , we currently owe china $ 277 billion .  that is what we owe them right now .  that is a 257 percent increase over 4 1/2 years ago .  we are going to have a 40-minute debate tonight on this particular issue .  in that 40 minutes , on average , over the last 4 1/2 years , america will have borrowed $ 3 million from china .  by the time we are finished talking , we will owe them another $ 3 million .  i do not want to pick on china .  china is only one of the issues .  it is not the only country .  in the last 4 1/2 years , 84 percent of all debt sold , all private debt sold by the united states government has been sold to foreign governments and foreign corporations of which china is only the second largest .  to me this is an important issue .  i support it .  i am glad we are taking action .  but more importantly , we had better wake up .  we are sending too many jobs , too much money , too much economic power overseas .  china is only one of them .  but they are a large one .  i just wanted to use this opportunity to make sure that we know this is only the beginning .  it is not the end .
