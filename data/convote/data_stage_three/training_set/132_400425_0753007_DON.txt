mr. chairman , i yield myself the remaining time .  this only calls on the president to come up with some ideas talking to the people that are heading up his agencies .  if he thinks he needs legislative authority , he should ask for it .  but at least it makes him focus on not wasting oil , and there is a lot of waste that goes on .  and the president can simply appeal to people : tune up your motors , promote oil savings in the industrial sector , keep vehicles properly tuned , improve the tire inflations , improve air traffic management .  some of these small things can add up to savings , and the savings we call for are the savings based on projections of future oil .  i ask for an `` aye '' vote .
