madam speaker , i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and for his diligent work on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of all americans as we are working on this bill and bringing it forward to the house , getting it ready to move forward and looking forward to the time that the president signs this into law , so that we do have an energy policy .  a couple of points i would like to highlight with my colleagues that the gentleman from nebraska brought forward to us , this bill is , as he said , forward thinking and it is now thinking , and it is important as we look at these two provisions that we realize it is this way because we have to think about small business .  we have to think about farmers .  we have to think about the impact of this on the economy .  madam speaker , as the gentleman from nebraska has said , this is about jobs .  we think about our economy .  this wonderful free enterprise system that we have in this great nation of ours has created nearly 3 million jobs in the past 2 years , and we need to continue that .  this economic engine needs to continue working .  we do not hear enough about the jobs creation that has happened .  we do not hear enough about the tax relief that has happened over the past couple of years , but we know that jobs creation is such an important part and an energy policy will serve as a boost for that jobs creation .
