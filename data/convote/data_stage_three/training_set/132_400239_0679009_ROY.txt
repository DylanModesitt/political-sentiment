mr. speaker , i appreciate my appropriations colleague yielding me a moment just to say that my colleague , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey )  , and i have spent a lot of time together discussing these questions and the schedule and otherwise .  the relationship is extremely positive , and i believe he and i this week , before the week is out , will have a chance to sit down and talk about 302 ( b ) s , for example .  we are going to move forward very expeditiously , and i think it will benefit , one more time , my colleague and i , who are appropriations members together , and it will benefit our committee greatly .
