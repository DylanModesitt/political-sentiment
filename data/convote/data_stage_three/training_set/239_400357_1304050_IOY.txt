taking back my time , and i thank the gentleman .  he says that it is unfair .  but we have had this trade agreement , we have been in the wto for 10 years .  we have had a democratic president .  we have had a republican president .  if it is unfair , why is the president of the united states not going to the wto tomorrow ?  why did bill clinton not go ?  i do not want to be partisan here .  why did neither of them go ?  and they are not going to go .  the issue here is that these trade agreements have been forced on congress , not forced , congress willfully did it , because of the power of big money .  it is no secret .  some of us who were here for nafta , some of us here for the china agreement , we know the millions and millions of dollars in campaign contributions and huge lobbying effort on the part of the large corporations .  because the truth of the matter is that while unfettered free trade is a disaster for the middle class and working families of this country , it really does benefit the heads of large corporations .  they are , in fact , doing very well .  we see general electric , general motors moving to china .  that is not a good thing for americans .  let me conclude simply by saying , mr. speaker , let us send the president of the united states a message .  let us say that our current trade policies are failing .  let us stand up for working families around the country .  let us pass this resolution .
