mr. chairman , i move to strike the last word and enter into a brief colloquy with the gentleman from arizona ( mr. kolbe )  .  mr. chairman , i believe it is important that all groups and organizations that want to assist in the recovery are allowed to participate .  the united states agency for international development issued a regulation on october 19 , 2004 , that ensures religious organizations are allowed to compete on an equal footing with other nongovernmental organizations for usaid funding , in the case of this bill , funding to help tsunami victims .  can the chairman clarify whether the appropriations under this bill fall under such regulation ?
