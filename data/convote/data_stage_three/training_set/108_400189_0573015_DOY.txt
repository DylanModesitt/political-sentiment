mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for that assurance .  as the gentleman knows , we have had some problems , at least from our perspective , in being included in the conferences from time to time .  that is an important one .  our citizens are confronting , as my colleague knows , very high gas prices , $ 2.20 , $ 2.30 , $ 2.50 in some areas of the country .  i understand that the committees of jurisdiction are expected to be marking up next week or are in the process of marking up the energy bill .  can the gentleman tell me when that bill might be on the floor ?
