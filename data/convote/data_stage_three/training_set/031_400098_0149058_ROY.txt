mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  let me just sum up and say this does not require anything from the states as far as driver 's licenses go .  states do not have to do anything under this for their driver 's licenses .  they can issue driver 's licenses to whomever they want .  but if they intend to use those licenses for federal purposes , we have a right to say what the criteria should be and under those circumstances , they are going to have to show legal presence .  it is not anti-immigrant .  in fact , this allows the states to issue two different sets : one for illegal immigrants , one for everyone else .  it takes the national security issue away from the argument there .  finally , the opt-out provisions in the current legislation that was passed just a few months ago are disastrous .  we were worse with the 9/11 response that passed this congress than we were without it .  this rectifies that .  it closes that loophole .  out of respect for the victims , the families , the work of the 9/11 commission , i urge my colleagues to support this legislation .
