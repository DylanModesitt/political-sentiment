mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman from maryland 's words , but i look at it a little differently .  after reading all the records and everything , what i do know is that there is a mother , a father , a brother , and a sister that want terri schiavo to live , and they want to take care of her .  i want to thank everybody that has worked on this bill , particularly those in the senate , the democrats in the senate , the republicans in the senate .  they passed this bill unanimously .  i want to thank the democrats in this house that worked on this bill , the republicans that worked on this bill .  some have tried to make it a partisan issue .  mr. speaker , after 4 days of words , the best of them uttered in prayer , now comes the time for action .  i say again , the legal and political issues may be complicated , but the moral ones are not .  a young woman in florida is being dehydrated and starved to death .  for 58 long hours , her mouth has been parched and her hunger pangs have been throbbing .  if we do not act , she will die of thirst .  however helpless , mr. speaker , she is alive .  she is still one of us .  and this can not stand .  terri schiavo has survived her passion weekend , and she has not been forsaken .  no more words , mr. speaker .  she is waiting .  the members are here .  the hour has come .  mr. speaker , call the vote .
