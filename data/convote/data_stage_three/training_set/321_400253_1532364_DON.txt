mr. chairman , i rise today to oppose the massive cuts to the title vii health professions training programs which play a critical role in addressing the shortage of doctors , nurses , dentists and other health professionals in underserved areas and have proven to increase the diversity of the health care workforce .  the republicans ' fiscal year 2006 budget gives away $ 106 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest in our society .  now , in order to pay for those cuts , they are making huge cuts to critical programs for the poor and the most vulnerable in our country .  the title vii health professions training programs are some of the many casualties of these tax giveaways .  in order to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy , this bill slashes funding for the title vii programs by 84 percent , cutting the programs from $ 300 million to $ 47 million .  these title vii programs promote access to quality health care to for our nation 's neediest citizens and they are only federal programs designed help prepare health professionals to respond to the needs of these special and underserved populations .  these programs are a vital component of the health education system in our country and are necessary to maintain the high quality health care that we expect .  these cuts will have a dramatic impact on the system at a time when essential health care services are already facing funding cuts and program eliminations .  i urge you to oppose these cuts and i am hopeful that the committee will work to increase funding for these programs in conference .
