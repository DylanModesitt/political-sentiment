mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his work on this issue and so many other important issues .  when i go home , and especially as a physician in congress , when i go home and talk to small businesses , they say whatever you do , whatever you do , do something about my health care costs .  make it so i can help my employees get insurance .  mr. speaker , 45 million uninsured we have heard , 60 percent or more of those are employed currently , and why do they not have health insurance .  either they are self-employed or they work for small businesses so they have to purchase health insurance in the individual market .  so what is the solution ?  pool together .  six people can buy insurance for cheaper than one person ; 60 cheaper than 6 ; 600 cheaper than 60 ; and 6 million cheaper than 600 , and it can be quality insurance , and h.r. 525 is a step in the right direction .  we have heard that the number of uninsured will go up , the cost for the premium will go up 23 percent .  i will take that wager .  this is the same crowd that said welfare reform would not work .  i will take that bet .  once again , the rhetoric we have heard is disgraceful .  we have heard that republicans do not care about women with breast cancer .  come on .  what kind of nonsense is this .  who do you think will be making the decisions about the kinds of provisions that will be in that insurance policy ?  it is patients .  it is patients in the associations , and they are much closer i would argue to the individuals making decisions about what is going to be included under those plans than human resources officers in large companies .  h.r. 525 is a step in the right direction .  i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it .
