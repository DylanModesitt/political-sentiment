mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , over the past 5 years , we have seen 100 , 000 federal housing units lost .  we are down 50 percent in real terms in elderly and disabled housing at a time when the leadership on the other side of the aisle has tried to eliminate the community development block grant program .  they have significantly cut back on the number of section 8 vouchers for low-income housing assistance , and they have tried to limit housing assistance overall , so it is important that this underlying bill pass and at the same time that this reprehensible provision , this attack on poor people , be struck from the bill .  mr. speaker , to prohibit organizations from receiving funding for housing , many of these organizations , faith-based organizations , that participate in nonpartisan activities , as the new york times said today , has no place in our democracy .  we can do so much better .  the fact of the matter is that many of these faith-based organizations that do an incredible job in housing will be barred from participating because of this provision .  vote down the rule .  let us fix this provision .
