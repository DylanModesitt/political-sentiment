mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , my colleague from georgia had kind of quoted from a study implying that most of these class-action cases would remain in states , that the whole purpose of this bill is to try to move them to federal courts .  let me quote from a cbo cost estimate which says that under this bill , most class-action lawsuits would be heard in federal district court , rather than in the state court .
