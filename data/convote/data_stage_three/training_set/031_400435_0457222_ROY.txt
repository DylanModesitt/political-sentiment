mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. kelly )  .  the gentlewoman is right , charles taylor has been responsible for having dealings with al qaeda and conflict diamonds .  charles taylor was the one responsible for cutting off arms and legs of young people in sierra leone and in liberia .  i think the gentlewoman is right , nigeria should return charles taylor so he can have a fair trial .  i think the administration has a moral obligation to ask the nigerians and get him back to go before the court .
