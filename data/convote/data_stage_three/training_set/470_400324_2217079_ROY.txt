mr. chairman , again , i appreciate the opportunity to speak on this great bill today , but i think we can add a few things .  we send our children off to school every day and we trust that our teachers are the best and the safest and the best trained in the country .  unfortunately , there are a small few , a number of teachers across this country who are slipping between the cracks .  in the state of nevada , we hire about 1 , 400 to 2 , 000 new teachers a year .  unfortunately , some states are not able to share information regarding the criminal activity of these particular teachers .
