madam chairman , i rise this afternoon to support h.r. 1279 , the gang deterrence and community protection act .  i was pleased to work with the committee on the judiciary , and especially the gentleman from virginia ( mr. forbes )  , my good friend , to support the legislation on the floor today .  according to the justice department , there are currently over 25 , 000 gangs and over 750 , 000 gang members who are active across the united states .  gang activity has been directly linked to the proliferation of illegal drugs , human trafficking , and many other violent crimes .  the gang deterrence and community protection act will authorize funds for joint federal , state , and local gang investigation prosecution ; create a statute to prosecute criminal gang enterprises similar to the existing rico statute used to prosecute federal racketeering ; create mandatory minimum sentencing for gang and violent crimes ; and fund gang investigation technology to allow law enforcement to act more efficiently .  madam chairman , many headlines of late have reflected on growing gang problems in heavily populated areas .  unfortunately , gang violence is also on the rise in rural areas , including my congressional district .  the disturbing news that it is spreading through the shenandoah valley of virginia is indeed disturbing .  in fact , the fbi has recognized the existence of at least six separate gangs in the valley , some of which are responsible for at least two gang-related murders in the past 2 years .  madam chairman , acknowledging the reality that gangs are no longer limited solely to urban areas , i am pleased to join my colleagues to support this gangbusters legislation .  this legislation will allow us to meet the increase in gang activity with resources sufficient to combat this scourge in our communities , and i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation .
