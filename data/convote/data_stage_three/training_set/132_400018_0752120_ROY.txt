madam chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume for the purpose of responding to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo )  and also to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from new hampshire .  first , let me simply say i understand the concern of the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo )  about the situation in the power markets in california 4 to 5 years ago , and i know she feels more needs to be done .  as we speak , there is litigation in process to have more done in that area .  i will say on the record , hundreds of millions , if not billions , of dollars have been reclaimed , indictments have been brought , cases have gone to court and convictions obtained and people sent to jail for some of the transgressions the gentlewoman alluded to .  while it is obvious that she feels more needs to be done , i think it does need to be stated on the record that quite a bit already has been done .
