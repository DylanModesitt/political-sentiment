mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  i do want to close , if there are no further speakers , and acknowledge that we have important work to be done here .  we have highly professional personnel at the border , and they are doing their job , but we need to provide more of them .  we need to fund the border security proposals that we have been putting forward for some time .  we need to be sure that we fund those .  but the other piece of that , and i am delighted that the gentleman from arizona ( mr. kolbe )  has brought that forward , is to be certain that the most sophisticated applications of that technology are used on the border .  i speak to many companies in san diego .  i know that they have a great interest in this .  they have been a part of some of these solutions in the past .  let us employ them ; let us be sure that we are doing this in a comprehensive fashion .  so i want to thank the gentleman from arizona ( mr. kolbe )  .  we must move forward in this area .  we can do a far better job on the border than we have done before .
