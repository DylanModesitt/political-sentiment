mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentleman 's comments .  i know that the gentleman does not approach this in any other fashion but a bipartisan fashion .  but the question i have is if we are going to limit this to two per year , it could be that five members on our side of the aisle have five individuals they want to recognize .  there could be five individuals on the republican side of the aisle who have five individuals they want to recognize .  that is 10 people , 10 bills , 10 instances where members have garnered two-thirds .  who then will decide who gets the medals ?  it then becomes a very political decision as to who gets each of the medals .  will it be the five on the majority side ?  will it be two from the majority side ?  will it be two from the minority side ?  will it be one each ?  who of the 10 deserving will get it , and who will not get it ?
