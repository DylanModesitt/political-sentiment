mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute .  the gentlewoman from california brought up the issue about bankruptcy reform harming veterans .  in speaking to that , senate 256 needs-based test includes several safeguards and exceptions for special circumstances , including those of veterans : a specific reference to a debtor who is subject to a call or ordered to active duty in the armed forces to the extent that such occurrences substantiate special circumstances .  s. 256 means test has a special exception just for debtors who are disabled veterans if the indebtedness occurred primarily during a period when the debtor was on active duty or performing a homeland security activity .  the bill excuses a debtor if he or she is on active military duty in a military combat zone from the mandatory credit counseling and financial management training requirements .  i could go on and on , mr. speaker ; but we are addressing , as we always have on this side of the aisle , the special needs of our great veterans of this country .
