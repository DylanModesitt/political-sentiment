madam chairman , i think i am on a different bill than i just heard described here .  i applaud the energy efficiency and conservation in this bill .  i applaud the increasing of renewable technologies in this bill .  i applaud the hydrogen fuel cell program in this bill .  i applaud the next-generation nuclear in this bill .  i applaud the clean coal technology .  i applaud the incentives for deep gas drilling .  that is the one issue i do not think we do enough in this bill .  i believe we need to do much more to increase the supply of natural gas , and i hope in conference we can .  current natural gas prices are exporting thousands of american jobs , the best jobs we have , the chemical plants , fertilizer factories , and those who melt steel and ore and use a lot of national gas .  we as a country have an island to ourselves with natural gas ; they are not world prices .  when everybody pays $ 50 for oil , we have the highest prices for natural gas of all modern countries , and we are losing the companies who use large quantities of it .  just to compare , we are 40 percent higher on natural gas than europe .  we are 50 percent higher than japan .  we are 600 percent higher than south america .  we are 800 percent higher than russia .  we heat our homes , our schools , our hospitals , and our businesses with natural gas .  it is the bridge to hydrogen .  all hydrogen today generally is made from natural gas ; it is the easiest way to make it .  it can assist us in transportation , with our buses , taxi cabs , delivery trucks , by using natural gas rather than oil .  we need , in the final bill , to have a much stronger chapter with natural gas ; it is the one area that i think we need stronger in this bill .
