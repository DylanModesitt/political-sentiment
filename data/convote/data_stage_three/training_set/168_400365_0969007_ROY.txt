madam chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds .  madam chairman , i deeply respect the arguments that have been advanced by the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff )  .  he put forth his proposal in committee , and it was defeated on a rollcall vote of 3 ayes to 22 noes .  so the schiff proposal did not even carry a majority of the democratic members in the committee , let alone the republican members .
