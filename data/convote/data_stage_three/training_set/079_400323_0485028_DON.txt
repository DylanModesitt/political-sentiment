mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman 's yielding to me and very much appreciate the constructive tone of his debate .  we actually have advanced provisions for the safeguarding of social security .  this democratic party which stood so strongly in preserving surplus dollars saved social security first , walling them off , the lockbox .  we saved social security revenues for social security .  and it is the democrat members of this body who are prepared to enter discussions when going-in principles are agreed to .  those principles : there shall be no insecurity added into social security and that there should be no additional federal borrowing , no vast amounts of federal borrowing .
