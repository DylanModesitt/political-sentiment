madam speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time .  i think the gentleman has done a great job in describing the contributions of two great giants from south texas .  i want to thank the gentleman from alaska ( mr. young )  and the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. mollohan )  and the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. shuster )  and all those involved who helped expedite this bill .  this is not the first time this bill has been before the house .  it has passed two or three times , but it has stalled in the senate .  this bill would rename the brownsville courthouse for two legislative giants from south texas .  this bill will rename the courthouse the reynaldo g. garza and the filemon b. vela united states courthouse .  we have a wealth of riches in south texas , including these two giants of men .  reynaldo garza was the first hispanic appointed to the federal bench by president john f. kennedy in 1961 and judge filemon vela was appointed to the federal bench by president jimmy carter back in 1980 .  both of these men have become legends in the south texas area by virtue of their commitment to education and to our community .  both heroes passed away last year .  this legislation is noncontroversial , and i hope the senate will quickly consider and pass this as well .  i thank the house and my friends for helping expedite this bill again to get to the floor .
