mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , i would like to close by thanking my colleagues for a productive discussion on the rule and the underlying bill .  today , this house has an opportunity to again pass meaningful reform to not only promote personal accountability but also to strengthen the opportunities for legitimate claims to be heard and adjudicated .  let us take one more step to turn back the tide of so-called `` jackpot justice. '' while runaway juries and frivolous lawsuits might make a few individuals and certain ambulance-chasing lawyers rich , the american people ultimately pay the price both economically and socially .  mr. speaker , discouraging individuals from taking personal responsibility does not help anyone .  in fact , it will only make matters worse .  encouraging healthy lifestyles and wise dietary choices should always trump rewarding poor decisions by shifting the blame to innocent bystanders .  the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 is a good bill , and i look forward to further discussing its merits on the house floor today .  mr. speaker , as i mentioned earlier , a strong bipartisan majority passed this bill in the last congress ; and i have no reason to doubt that we should be able to pass it again by a similar , maybe even a stronger , margin ; and i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill .
