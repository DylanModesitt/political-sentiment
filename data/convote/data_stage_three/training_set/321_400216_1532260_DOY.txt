mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. chairman , i have been involved in defending indian sovereignty for 40 years when i began my tenure in the michigan legislature .  and i will never abdicate my responsibility on that .  i think it is extremely important that this congress on an issue so delicate and so important to two groups for whom we have great affection , be done in the appropriate committee , the committee of jurisdiction .  the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner )  and i have discussed having hearings in that committee .
