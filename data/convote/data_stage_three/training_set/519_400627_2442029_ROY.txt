mr. speaker , i hope the american people are watching this debate ; and if they are watching this debate on tv , i hope they have a video recorder , because they need to record this debate .  when you are talking in your church or in your home or where you work about high fuel prices , you can play this and let people see why we have the prices that we have right now ; why they are going to be paying more for home heating oil ; why they are paying more for gasoline , because this side of the aisle over here does not understand the problems that we have in this country .  play it ; listen to it .  you are an individual out there .  you can car pool if you want to .  if you want to buy a car that gets 50 miles to the gallon , they make them every day .  you can go buy them by the hundreds .  if you want to buy a car that gets 10 miles to the gallon , that is up to you .  you are an individual , and you have individual responsibilities .  let us quit blaming the people who are trying to be leaders in this country and put us on the right track for an energy policy .
