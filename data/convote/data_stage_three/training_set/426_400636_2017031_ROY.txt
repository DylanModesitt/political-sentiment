i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  mr. speaker , first of all , i have respect for our insurance commissioners , but i want to say that three out of the last four in louisiana went to jail .  so that is no automatic protection .  i think other states have had similar problems .  the preemption language in the bill only grants two limited exceptions from state laws that regulate insurance .  fully insured ahps are exempted from state laws that would , one , preclude them from establishing an ahp ; or , two , prevent them from designing their own benefit package .  these two exemptions are narrowly tailored to allow ahps to set a uniform benefit package that can be offered across state lines and to ensure that state regulators will not pass laws that prohibit the establishment of ahps .  state laws that regulate insurance and do not impact benefit design will apply , including prompt pay , external review , and solvency requirements .  assistant secretary ann combs testified to this at a march 2003 subcommittee on employer-employee relations hearing .  at that hearing she noted that , quote , `` fully insured ahps would purchase insurance products with solvency standards and consumer protections regulated by the states. '' further specifying which state laws are not preempted is unnecessary .  all state laws will apply except those that prevent a uniform benefit design or prevent an ahp from existing .  consumer protection laws that states see fit to pass will apply to fully insured ahps .  no further change in the legislation is necessary .  benefit mandates , as we have discussed , will be preempted as is the case for unions and large employers .
