mr. chairman , i would like to submit a statement for the record from the americans for tax reform .  february 9 , 2005 .  our nation 's immigration and border control policies cry out for reform .  while our best border control officers should be preventing the next terrorist incursion into our country , they are instead hunting down willing workers .  the attacks of september 11th called for new and updated thinking in all areas of federal law enforcement , and immigration reform has been a glaring omission .  america 's immigration system must be reformed in a responsible , welcoming , adult manner along the lines laid out by president bush .  willing workers should be matched with willing employers , citizenship and residency applications must be streamlined , and the focus must shift to protecting the nation from terrorists .  border security has been increased since 9/11 , and should continue to be so .  the latest technology must be used to make sure america 's border is free of terrorist incursions .  in order to let the border guard do their job of defending america , the president supports giving foreign laborers guest worker cards , `` to match willing workers with willing employers. '' president bush is opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants .  he also does not want to give foreigners in the guest worker program any advantage over those who are trying to become citizens through normal , due process channels .  congress should support president bush 's common-sense plan to reform and strengthen america 's broken immigration system even as border security is addressed today in the house of representatives .  grover norquist ,
