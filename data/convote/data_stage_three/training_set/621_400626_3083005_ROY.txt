if the gentleman will yield for just a moment , i appreciate the gentleman 's insight and expertise because it really crystallizes so importantly the correct way to view tax relief and deficits .  this is a chart i know the gentleman is familiar with , and it shows the current deficit that we have and it shows a decreasing deficit , in fact , a significantly decreasing deficit , with the deficit declining $ 138 billion .  that is $ 138 billion in the last 18 months , and that is at the same time that we have seen tax relief .  i wonder if the gentleman would mind commenting about that and how it is that tax relief can result in deficit reduction .
