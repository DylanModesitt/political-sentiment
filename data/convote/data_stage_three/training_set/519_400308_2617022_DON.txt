the gentleman from ohio ( mr. ryan )  talked about prevention before in the context of health care .  it is not just iraq versus america , it is the fact that these cuts are plain stupid .  we talk about prevention in terms of health care , by eliminating community health centers , people go to emergency centers , and it costs more .  an argument could be made if we did not cut funding for the levees in louisiana , we may not even have had the crisis there .
