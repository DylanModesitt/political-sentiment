mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman yielding .  the campaign finance committees are still working on those issues .  it is quite possible that we could address those issues in september .  the way that i am watching the schedule of the other body , we will probably be here at least a week or two after october 1 , and we would be working on those issues .  i have every expectation that the committee on ways and means will put out a retirement security bill for us to consider in september or the first of october .  and , i am sure the gentleman remembers , we have a reconciliation process that is ongoing .  we could have a reconciliation bill in that time period .  so those are some of the major issues that we will be facing in september and october .
