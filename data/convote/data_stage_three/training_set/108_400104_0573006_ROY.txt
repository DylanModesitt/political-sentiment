mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman yielding .  we do not know at this point , and we will certainly advise the gentleman when we have that .  the problem is because of this shortened week , we have committees that are marking up next week that had planned to mark up this week , and we have to try to work out the schedule so that we can make it as convenient for those markups as possible .
