madam chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 6 .  for too many years , madam chairman , our domestic energy policy has languished , driving investment overseas and increasing our reliance on foreign energy resources .  yet , we continue the cycle of tolerating irresponsible energy policies , continuing to discourage investment in domestic energy production and , subsequently , becoming more dependent on foreign sources of energy .  relying on foreign and , sometimes , hostile nations for energy and minerals jeopardizes our national security , madam chairman .  and for the safety and security of our homeland , i want the united states to be reasonably self-sufficient in meeting the demands of our current energy consumption .  h.r. 6 makes strides in ensuring our domestic security by streamlining the permitting process for renewable and traditional sources of energy , while protecting the integrity of the environmental review process .  h.r. 6 also contains provisions to spur production of renewable energies such as geothermal so we can reduce our reliance on traditional sources .  through this important legislation , we will have increased ability to utilize the vast renewable energy resources on our public lands in an environmentally responsible manner .  i urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation that will allow us to capitalize on our nation 's energy exploration and development technology , commitment to environmental quality and conservation , and work ethic to develop our domestic energy resources .
