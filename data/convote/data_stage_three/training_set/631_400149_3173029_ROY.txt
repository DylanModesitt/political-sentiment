mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time .  mr. speaker , this task force creates an opportunity to bypass , eliminate the bureaucracy and fragmentation of the myriad of jurisdictions of this body .  this task force creates a new dynamic .  it brings people in , democrats , republicans .  it brings the public into the process .  it brings scientists into the process .  it brings people who work in all the various marine industries into the process to evaluate , to analyze in a very clinical manner the ocean commission recommendations .  this is about specific recommendations coming out of a bipartisan task force with the idea that we eliminate bureaucracy ; we eliminate the committee jurisdiction problems and hand to these various committees the specific recommendations that we have evaluated over this 6-month period of time .  the subcommittee is moving legislation with the recommendations from the ocean commission report and the pew commission report on oceans .  we are dealing with what to do about sanctuaries , marine protected areas , coral reefs , marine debris , magnuson issues , ecosystem management of the fisheries .  all of these things subject to our jurisdiction and the rules of the house are being moved through that subcommittee .  i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the task force .
