mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i have a little different view of this .  this is a good bill .  it is a bill this country needs .  we need a national energy policy , there is no question about it , and i congratulate the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton )  on years of hard , dedicated work to bring this to the floor .  having said that , like any other bill i have ever seen , it is not a perfect bill ; it has its good and bad parts .  and if i could , mr. chairman , just for the record , i would like to have a little quick colloquy with the gentleman from texas .
