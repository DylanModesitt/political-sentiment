mr. speaker , let me reiterate what i said about nitpicking and arcane rules .  this whole bill is a violation of the rules of the house except for the fact that it says in the bill it does not violate the rules .  so telling us that we should have respect for the rules , my colleagues ought to show some respect for the good sense of the american people , for common sense .  this whole bill is a violation of the rules without a waiver .  is that not true , mr. chairman ?  would this bill be a violation of the rules if there was not a waiver involved in the rules ?  as i said , the rules are being used to damage common sense and to damage our nation 's security and damage our health care to our veterans .  i think it is a disgrace to use those rules for these purposes .
