mr. chairman , i come to the floor today to speak in support of the real id act .  it is clear that in order to secure our country from terrorists we need to reform the requirements and standards for driver 's licenses .  a valid driver 's license is like a hall pass that allows terrorists to easily roam throughout the united states .  indeed 19 terrorists did just that with dozens of legal driver 's licenses and identification cards .  the hijackers used these ids to rent cars and apartments , open bank accounts , take flying lessons , and otherwise blend into american society while they planned their attacks .  those terrorists murdered 3 , 000 americans and yet this gap still remains open .  in every state , the driver 's license ( and its counterpart , the state id card ) is the primary document used to establish identity and proof of legal residence .  making driver 's licenses accessible to illegal aliens gives them the means to pass themselves off as legal residents of the united states .  additionally , the real id act does not create a national id card .  in addition to establishing standards for the issuance of licenses , h.r. 418 includes provisions to prevent terrorists from gaming our asylum system .  court decisions in recent years have so distorted the asylum process that terrorists are now able to claim asylum specifically because they are terrorists .  this legislation represents a critical first step toward gaining control over our borders and protecting american lives .  these are common-sense measures that should be implemented immediately .  terrorism may have no borders , but we can certainly make it more difficult for terrorists to cross ours .  having a uniform policy that relies on common sense will do more to keep america open and free than having a policy that relies on hope .
