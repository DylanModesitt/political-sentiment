mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , a girl from indianapolis , indiana .  for the life of me , i can not understand why we are here .  we were all snatched out of our houses of worship to run to washington to violate the trial of the judicial , the legislative , and the administrative .  but i guess the leadership understands what it is .  they are calling it a wedge between democrats and republicans , i am calling it what is right and what is wrong .  we have no business being here .  there are families across this country who are losing their medicare right now because of the policy we set , and they can not get any more .  the doctors are screaming .  i am sure a lot of people have heard them .  they are screaming to their congress people saying give our medicare and our medicaid back or else we can not treat these patients .  yet we are going to make one single case in florida get all the medicare they want .  my heart goes out to this family .  i know this is a very dark season for them .  i know justice will prevail and god will have the last answer .  but congress should not have the last answer because it is none of our business .  this is called meddling .
