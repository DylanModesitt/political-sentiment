mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding .  the gentleman 's original question was when will we see a conference report for the budget come to the floor .  i am hoping as soon as possible , obviously .  i have no idea when the negotiations with the house and the senate will start in earnest , when we will appoint the conference committee .  there is very little difference , quite frankly , from the house bill and the senate bill , and i would assume that the major issues will be taken care of in a matter of days , if not a couple of weeks .  so i would assume that we could have a conference report on a budget hopefully by the first of may .  at least that is what we would like to see happen .
