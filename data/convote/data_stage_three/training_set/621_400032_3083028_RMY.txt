i thank the gentleman from texas , and i thank him so much for being here to talk with us tonight about why this is important legislation and why it is important that we stop a tax increase on the american people .  and we have talked about so many of these issues tonight .  mr. speaker , this economy is booming .  inflation is low .  unemployment is near historic lows .  we saw that 4.1 percent growth with the quarter that ended in september of 2005 .  and i think it is important to realize that this just did not happen .  it did not just happen .  and i know that my constituents certainly remember the recession the president confronted when he took office , and they remember the impact that september 11 had on our economy .  we did not bury our heads in the sand when that happened .  we rolled up our sleeves .  we got to work .  we passed tax reforms and tax relief , and tomorrow is our opportunity to extend that .  mr. speaker , i encourage all members of this body to join us in supporting h.r. 4297 tomorrow .
