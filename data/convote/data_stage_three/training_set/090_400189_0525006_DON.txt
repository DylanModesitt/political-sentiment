reclaiming my time , mr. speaker , the majority leader anticipated my next question .  and i appreciate your comments .  this is , obviously , a very serious issue and we are prepared to deal with it seriously .  we appreciate the fact that this provides for sufficient time in debate for the issues to be raised and addressed by the house of representatives .  my second question , which you have anticipated , is that in fact members can expect at 12 midnight , at the conclusion of the 3 hours of debate between 9 p.m .  and 12 midnight , for the vote to occur on the pending legislation ; is that accurate ?
