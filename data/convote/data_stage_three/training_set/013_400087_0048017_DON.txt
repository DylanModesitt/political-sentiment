mr. chairman , if the gentleman will continue to yield , that is the point i am trying to make .  to say that the code talkers , and i am not saying the gentleman is suggesting this , but to suggest that they did not deserve the ultimate award , even as a group , for what they provided to the service of this country during world war ii is just ridiculous .  they certainly deserved as a group .  any one individual , no .  there were multiple individuals who provided an incredible service to us .  i would also point out that two is not individual .  two individuals makes up a group , to my understanding , and that would include nancy and ronald reagan .  that would include any husband and wife , including dr .  king and coretta scott king .  that would preclude them from getting this medal in the future .  that is my understanding of the legislation before us .
