mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 418 .  although i support the goals of this legislation , h.r. 418 unfortunately contains too many misguided provisions .  last year , i voted to pass the 9/11 commission 's bipartisan recommendations to reform identification standards and beef up security on our nation 's border .  this legislation would repeal that new law before it has a chance to work .  had the provisions of h.r. 418 been in place prior to september 11 , 2001 , they would not have stopped a single one of the 19 terrorists .  h.r. 418 would force virtually every adult in the united states to go to the dmv to get a new driver 's license , and with 14 , 000 local jurisdictions in this country currently issuing identification , it would be impossible to impose a single standard within in the three-year limit in the bill .  i will also vote to remove provisions
