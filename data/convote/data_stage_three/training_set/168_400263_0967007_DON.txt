mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to respond to my colleague by saying that all the groups he has mentioned , and so many more , also support the cops program , too , which the president has cut by $ 40 million .  we can talk all we want about using all this harsh rhetoric , but the bottom line is , there are laws already on the books if you commit a violent crime in this country .  right now , if you commit a murder , you will go to jail .  one of the things that is most troubling to me as we talk about how we make our communities safer , there is no talk about the fact that we are cutting funds for our local police departments .  we need more police on the streets .  that is not the only answer here , but clearly , the answer is not cutting the cops program , which the republican majority in this house is doing , and the president has suggested in his budget .
