mr. speaker , i am going to vote to send this bill along to the conference and vote `` yes '' for two reasons : first , i think the bill very wisely includes relief for multi-employer plans , an issue that many of us have worked on for a very long period of time .  these are plans run by small businesses who find large contributions to be very stifling to their ability to compete .  i think this relief is long overdue , and it is the principle reason that i will vote to send the bill along to conference .  the second reason is i think conference will finally be the forum where some very serious flaws in the bill can be addressed and renegotiated .  mr. miller 's substitute , which unfortunately was not made in order under this rule , addresses those flaws .  first of all , the law makes it far too easy for failed pension plans to be dumped into the pension benefit guarantee corporation .  mr. miller  and mr. rangel  had ideas that would preclude that dumping from happening .  they ought to be adopted .  second , i think the law ought to make it clear that there can not be bias or favoritism in favor of highly compensated people at the expense of the rank and file .  mr. rangel  and mr. miller 's substitute accomplishes that .  the underlying bill does not .  these and some other issues , i believe , need to be worked out in the conference .  i think , unfortunately , they should have been worked out on this house floor with a proper rule , but with those reservations i will vote to send the bill along to conference .
