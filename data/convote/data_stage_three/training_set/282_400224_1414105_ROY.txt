mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and i thank the gentleman from indiana for his comments .  i want to be very clear that i am in strong support of this legislation that has come forward by the committee on international relations , but there are things that raise my interest and my concern .  a few weeks ago media outlets throughout the world proudly parroted amnesty international 's unfounded charges of torture and ill treatment in the so-called america `` gulags. '' instead of condemning the government-inflicted famine in kim jong-il 's north korea or continued human rights abuses in castro 's cuba , the executive director of amnesty international usa revealed the true goal of organizations such as his when he called on foreign governments to arrest and prosecute u.s. government officials and military personnel .  we want to make sure that we have got language in here that would prevent that .  the belgian experience , for example , and recent propaganda espoused by amnesty international shows that we were wise to doubt the merchants who were peddling `` universal jurisdiction '' at the cost of national sovereignty .  indeed , even president clinton did not send the rome statute establishing the international criminal court to the u.s. senate because of its fundamental flaws .  the united states is a nation dedicated to justice and the rule of law , and we can not allow these fundamental protections to be stripped from our servicemen and women performing peacekeeping missions , and i think we in this body need to be ever vigilant to ensure that that does not happen .
