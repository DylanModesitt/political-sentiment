mr. chairman , i rise today to speak in support of the children 's safety act of 2005 .  this legislation , if passed , will close the loopholes in the current system that allow sexual predators to evade law enforcement .  it will enhance the current sex offender registration and community notification law .  it will create a comprehensive national system for sex offender registration , improve information exchange between states when sex offenders move from state to state , and increase penalties for failing to comply with the registration law .  i would like to commend the chairman for bringing this outstanding package to the floor today .  i am very grateful that the chairman has included several provisions from a bill that i introduced entitled the sexual predator sentencing act of 2005 .  these provisions would toughen several existing sentencing guidelines and keep sex offenders off the street .  provisions incorporated from my bill will increase the criminal penalties and establish mandatory minimums for those that harm our children whether it is over the internet or in person .  strong laws that hold the criminal accountable are a vital component in the effort to protect children .  those who abduct children are often serial offenders who have already been convicted of similar offenses .  strong sentencing is an essential component in any effort to fight crimes against children .  this legislation contains many vital provisions in protecting our children from these violent predators .  our children must be protected against repeat sexual offenders .  the children 's safety act of 2005 should be passed to keep sexual predators behind bars and our children safe .
