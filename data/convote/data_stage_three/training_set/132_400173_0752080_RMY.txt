madam chairman , earlier this year i reintroduced the residential solar energy tax credit act , which would provide a 15 percent tax credit for the purchase of solar water heating systems and photovoltaic systems to be installed in residential settings .  the maximum amount of this credit is $ 2 , 000 and the credit can not apply to solar energy systems used to heat swimming pools .  i am pleased this provision has been included in the tax title to h.r. 6 , the energy policy act of 2005 .  the solar energy industry in our nation has been growing at a clip of 25 percent per year for the past several years , yet u.s. manufacturers export 75 percent of their products because of the higher up-front costs of solar energy systems as compared to other energy sources .  purchasing a solar energy system is like buying a car and prepaying for all the gas it would ever need .  this makes consumers understandably hesitant despite the environmental and other gains associated with solar energy .  national polls consistently find that over 85 percent of americans want greater support for solar power , and solar power can play a role in our energy mix from coast to coast .  it is my belief that the residential solar tax credit will help advance this important form of renewable energy .  and in stark contrast to the protestations of my friends on the left , we are willing to embrace these technologies .  it is proven by this solar energy tax credit .  i thank the chairman for its inclusion .  i urge support of the legislation .
