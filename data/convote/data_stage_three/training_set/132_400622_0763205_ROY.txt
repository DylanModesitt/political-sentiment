mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the energy policy act of 2005 .  this important legislation is critical to protecting and preserving our nation 's freedom , security , and prosperity .  over the past decade , the united states ' energy consumption has increased by more than twelve percent ; however , our domestic production has increased by less than one-half of one percent .  that means that our nation is more and more reliant on foreign sources of energy .  when our nation depends on just a few countries for the majority of our energy , this adversely impacts american security .  this is unacceptable .  mr. chairman , the energy policy act of 2005 sets forth a comprehensive national energy policy .  it reduces foreign energy dependence by requiring conservation and domestic exploration .  by using less energy and opening up new areas for environmentally-responsible exploration , we will become less dependent on foreign sources of energy .  finally , the energy policy act of 2005 will provide an environment of certainty and stability that will foster prosperity in america .  rising energy prices is like a tax that americans must pay everyday in the form of higher gas prices , higher costs to heat and cool our homes , and higher prices to move products across the country .  having a comprehensive energy policy will allow businesses to flourish as we will have reliable and dependable sources of energy .  mr. chairman , as a supporter of the energy policy act of 2005 , i encourage my colleagues to vote for this responsible measure .
