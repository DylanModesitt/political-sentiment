mr. chairman , i look forward to having an opportunity to work with my colleagues from oregon and california in the near future in order to address the expansion of casino gambling to off-reservation sites .  i thank the gentleman for allowing me to address this issue of concern to my district .  in my pennsylvania district , the delaware tribes of oklahoma have filed suit in order to acquire the right to establish a casino .  their claim is based on a conveyance that allegedly occurred in 1737 before our nation 's independence .  the land that they claim is home to at least 25 local families , and also contains the binney and smith manufacturing plant , the maker of crayola crayons .  these tribes , who are based out of state , are only interested in seeing working and senior pennsylvanians gamble away their hard-earned dollars .  they are not concerned about the valuable manufacturing jobs jeopardized as a result of the displacement caused by this casino , or the fact that binney and smith/crayola makes a useful product loved by children all over the world .  i am concerned about this kind of reservation shopping , and i look forward to working with my colleagues from california and oregon and michigan and elsewhere in order to limit these tribes ' ability to build new casinos on properties not contiguous to existing reservations or on those lands where ownership is based solely on a conveyance that predates the existence of our nation .
