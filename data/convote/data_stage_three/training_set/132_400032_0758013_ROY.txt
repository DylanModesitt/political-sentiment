i thank the gentleman from iowa for spending some time with us .  he is exactly right , madam speaker .  this is a homeland security and an economic security issue .  we realize that .  competitiveness is important .  we know , just as the gentleman said , we are meeting today 's needs .  we can not not address the needs of today .  that does require us to address oil and gas .  at the same time we have to build that bridge to the future .  this bill does that and does put the focus on biodiesel , biomass , ethanol , wind , hydropower , hybrid cars , hydrogen fuel cells , solar power , and all of those alternative and renewable energy sources so that we will have a goal of reducing that dependence on foreign oil .
