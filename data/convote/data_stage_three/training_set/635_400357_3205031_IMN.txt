mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 2830 , the so-called pension protection act .  it should be pointed out that h.r. 2830 is opposed by aarp , by the pension rights center , and pension advocates across the country .  while i recognize that the republican leadership included some modest provisions to attract some union support , h.r. 2830 still has a number of provisions that will jeopardize the retirement security of millions of american workers .  among other harmful provisions , this bill would legalize age discrimination in cash balance pension conversions .  year after year , congress has voted against cash balance pension conversions because of the harm they have caused older workers .  mr. speaker , we do not tolerate discrimination in this country based on race , gender , religion , or disability ; and we must not tolerate discrimination based on age with regard to pensions .  unfortunately , that is exactly what h.r. 2830 does .  according to the gao , cash balance conversions without protections slash the pension benefits of an average 50-year-old by $ 238 a month .  younger workers are also hurt .  as the gao reported , a typical 30-year-old would see his or her pension benefits slashed by $ 59 a month under a cash balance conversion .  h.r. 2830 would legitimize these harmful pension cuts by legalizing cash balance conversions without requiring employers to protect older workers .  that is wrong .  mr. speaker , let me read to you what the aarp and the pension rights center have to say about this legislation .  according to the aarp : `` we can not support legislation that would clarify the legal status of cash balance pension plans without providing protections for older , long-service workers involved in cash balance plan conversions. '' i urge a `` no '' vote .
