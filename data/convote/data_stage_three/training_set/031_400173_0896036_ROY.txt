mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for this time .  i rise in strong support of this conference report as the people 's house at long last takes care of some unfinished business .  in the closing days of the 108th congress , some in the other body objected to commonsense provisions that deal with our national security and our border security , to wit , the notion that when you apply for a driver 's license or another legal document , you should be who you say you are , and you should enjoy legal status in this country .  this supplemental conference report includes the real id act , and at long last the congress of the united states gets real and understands that border security and national security are one and the same .  pass this to help protect our borders and help protect our national security .
