mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman 's courtesy .  we are fond of saying around here that the world changed after september 11 , but the energy bill did not .  this bill is virtually identical to dick cheney 's energy task force and where the house has been these last 4 years with concerns , notwithstanding the enron scandal , skyrocketing gasoline prices and demands on scarce oil supplies in unstable parts of the world .  it is ironic that the american public 's vision is much clearer than congress .  they want to increase the cafe standards .  the public has very clear views about the arctic wildlife refuge , that it is the last place america should look for oil , not the next place .  they oppose a waiver and relief to the mtbe manufacturers at the expense of state and local authorities and the quality of local drinking water .  this bill is looking at our energy problem through a rearview mirror .  it gives too much to the wrong people to do the wrong thing and is dramatically out of step with what the american public wants and needs .  the politics of today and yesterday 's policies do not provide an energy road map for the future .  it is true that lots of people have been working very hard on this bill , but i would suggest that never have so many worked so hard and so long to do so little to change the direction of this country 's energy future .  for the sake of the country , one hopes that there will come a time when the needs and wishes of the public is heard and it will be reflected in an energy policy for this century , cost-effective and rational ; preserving the quality of life , rather than operating on the cheap .
