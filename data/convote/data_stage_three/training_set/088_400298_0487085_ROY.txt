mr. chairman , i yield myself as much time as i may consume to just respond gently , firmly in some respects to some of the characterizations i disagree with of the budget that i am presenting and the republicans are presenting .  i definitely respect the congressional black caucus in their effort to put together a budget .  i admire anybody who tries to go through this process and comes out of the other end with an actual work product that they can come to the floor to defend .  so , as a result of that , i am pleased to yield time so that they can present that budget .
