mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this rule and h.r. 418 , the real id act of 2005 .  the 9/11 commission report stated that the abuse of the immigration system and a lack of interior immigration enforcement were unwittingly working together to support terrorist activity .  this bill will establish common-sense requirements for proof of identification for all driver 's licenses and state-issued identification cards .  this would stop the abuse of our asylum system by terrorist aliens and finish construction of a border fence that will secure one of the most trafficked corridors for illegal aliens and safeguard the united states naval base in san diego , california .  we know that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some type of u.s. identification documents .  in fact , the 19 hijackers had 63 driver 's licenses among them .  these licenses assisted the terrorists in boarding commercial flights , renting cars and other activities necessary to carry out their horrible plans .  this legislation ensures that terrorists will not be able to game our system any longer and we can not allow mass murderers into our country any longer .  mr. speaker , according to the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement agency , more than 3 million illegal aliens came across our border last year , and i bet probably more than that .  we have no idea where they are or where they are from .  however we do know that during the 9-month period from october , 2003 , through june , 2004 , over 44 , 000 non-mexican aliens were caught trying to cross the northern and southern u.s. borders .  among these aliens , several hundred were from the mideast countries unfriendly to the united states .  without this legislation , many more will come ; and this is a risk we can not afford to take .
