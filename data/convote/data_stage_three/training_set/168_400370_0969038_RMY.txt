mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 1279 , which will increase the prosecution of gangs and help prevent gang-related crimes .  gang violence is a serious problem , and we need to address it with determination and creativity .  a recent rash of gang-related violence has left four injured and one person dead in the city of norwalk this year .  my own home town of bridgeport has faced a tough gang problem for years .  it is absolutely essential we have strong legislation on the books to send gang members who commit violent acts into jail and off our streets .  i want to stress , however , the importance of prevention programs to deter our vulnerable youth from turning to gangs to support .  the mentoring program in the norwalk public school system , which will benefit from the recent department of education federal grant we secured , plays a strong role in keeping kids off the streets .  the bottom line is , while we need to make sure juvenile offenders understand the consequences of their actions and are punished for them , we need to make every effort to help youth who are at risk of becoming juvenile offenders .  mentoring programs designed to reduce children 's juvenile delinquency and involvement in gangs and provide positive relationships to help guide them during their school years are an invaluable way to break the cycle of gang membership before it begins .  incarceration will put criminals away but it wo n't save more kids from falling through the cracks and turning to a life of crime .
