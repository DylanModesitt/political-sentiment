i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  mr. chairman , i just want to , first of all , express what an honor and privilege it is to work on a subcommittee that works in such a bipartisan way with the great leadership of the chairman and the ranking member .  it is really a pleasure to actually get into policy discussions rather than a lot of the politics that we hear around here .  it is very much appreciated .  also , the tremendous staff that we have on this subcommittee .  i think the gentleman from tennessee ( mr. wamp )  mentioned the great professionalism that they have on both sides of the aisle .  it is a real pleasure .  this bill is a really good bill under an allocation that could always be larger .  we have worked out , i think , everything possible we can with the dollars available .  i am very appreciative of the fact that we have focused on renewable energy , the kind of important work that we do on the river , on the mississippi , and other projects that are involved also .  i want to commend the chairman and the ranking member and urge support of this very , very good bill .
