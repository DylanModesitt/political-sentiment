mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from new york ( mr. rangel )  for yielding me time .  the chairman did raise a rhetorical question .  let me give a rhetorical answer .  we are all so desperate here after these 10 years of republican rule to do something about amt we are prepared to vote for any procedure that comes before this institution just to hopefully move it along .  remember , when the republicans took control , 200 , 000 people were paying amt .  next year 19.3 million people will be paying alternative minimum tax .
