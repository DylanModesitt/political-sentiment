madam speaker , i would also like to discuss the home state exception in the legislation .  new subsections 1332 ( d ) ( 3 ) and ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) address the jurisdictional principles that will apply to class actions filed against the defendant in its home state , dividing such cases into three categories .  first , for cases in which two-thirds or more of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the suit was filed , section 1332 ( d ) ( 4 ) ( b ) states that federal jurisdiction will not be extended by s. 5 .  such cases will remain in state courts .  second , cases in which more than two-thirds of the members of the plaintiff class are not citizens of the state in which the action was filed will be subject to federal jurisdiction .  federal courts should be able to hear such lawsuits because they have a predominantly interstate component .  they affect people in many jurisdictions , and the laws of many states will be at issue .  finally , there is a middle category of class actions in which more than one-third , but fewer than two-thirds , of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are all citizens of the state in which the action was filed .  in such cases , the numbers alone may not always confirm that the litigation is more fairly characterized as predominantly interstate in character .  new subsection 1332 ( d ) ( 3 ) , therefore , gives federal courts discretion in the interests of justice to decline to exercise jurisdiction over such cases based on the consideration of five factors .  madam speaker , i would ask the chairman to explain these factors .
