mr. chairman , i yield myself 15 seconds .  in response to the gentleman from new hampshire ( mr. bass )  , i show him the headline in the newspaper of a little town in my district , where they had to sue chevron for $ 9 billion for contamination of the water supply and it was settled out of court .  they never would have gotten the settlement without the lawsuit .
