mr. speaker , first let me yield myself 30 seconds to point out that i wish we did have provisions in this bill to deal with the airline industry , because i think we should .  the problem is that we do not , and we go to conference with a situation where those who have well-funded plans are now likely to be asked to pay because of the costs of the airline industry .  and let me also point out from mr. boehner 's comment about making the pbgc better funded , if we have a lot of terminated plans , it is not going to be better funded .  and the gentleman brags about a permanent yield curve which is unpredictable to business .  it would be better to have a corporate bond rate , and i am sorry that is not in the legislation .
