mr. chairman , if i were voting for a budget that cut veterans benefits by $ 14 billion over the next 5 years , i guess i would want to talk about the past rather than the future as well .  the difference is very clear , and it is very simple .  republicans voting for this bill say that it is okay to cut veterans health care benefits by $ 14 billion over the next 5 years .  democrats and national veterans organizations say it is wrong .  in fact , the dav , the vfw say it is a grossly inadequate budget , it is an unconscionable budget , especially at a time when america 's sons and daughters are being killed and wounded every day in iraq .
