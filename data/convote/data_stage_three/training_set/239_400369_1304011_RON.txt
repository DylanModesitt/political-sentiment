mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  a lot of astounding remarks have been made since i stood up here and introduced this resolution , in the negative .  there are a couple of things i think we need to really talk about .  what has been the economic growth of the united states ?  how fast is our economy growing ?  it is growing at the rate of 4 percent .  how fast is the economy in europe growing ?  it is 1 percent .  how fast is the european economy growing ?  it is 1 percent .  the china economy is growing at 9 percent , but let us look at what that means .  nine percent of the chinese economy is less than 4 percent of our economy .  so i can say with all certainty that we have , in terms of dollars , the fastest growing economy in the world .  no question about that .  and of this economy , what percentage is exports ?  it is 25 percent .  are we not concerned about those jobs ?  and when we talk about the loss of jobs in the united states , we are not talking about a net loss ; we are talking about , yes , there has been some loss of jobs and , yes , a lot of these jobs have been because of foreign competition , yes .  but our economy has grown in other areas , so it has also created jobs .  if we look at just the jobless rate of where we are now and where we were a few years ago , we are doing pretty darn good .  if we look at the world economy , we are doing really good .  so why would we want to send a message to the administration by attempting to throw the world economy into chaos ?  it makes absolutely , absolutely no sense .
