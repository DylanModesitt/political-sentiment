madam chairman , i have the greatest respect for the gentleman from alaska ( mr. young )  , and i simply have a difference of opinion with him on this despite that great respect .  in what has become a congressional ritual , the prospect of drilling in the arctic has been repeatedly struck down in recognition of the fact that american working families do not want it .  still , we have proponents telling us that drilling is good for jobs .  some of the nation 's largest unions , i might point out , like the seiu , united auto workers , united steelworkers , and united farm workers , are on record opposing drilling in the arctic refuge .  why ?  because it is bad labor policy .  oil production is one of the least labor-intensive industries , supporting fewer than three direct jobs per $ 1 million of investment .  energy efficiency supports 27 jobs for the same investment .  it is also bad economic policy .  one dollar spent on petroleum production creates only $ 1.51 in economic value .  but that same dollar , when invested in energy efficiency , creates $ 2.23 in economic value .  our nation 's energy policy should not include drilling in the arctic .
