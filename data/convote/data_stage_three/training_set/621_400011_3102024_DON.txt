mr. speaker , i am well aware of the issues with amt .  the issue with me is this : you have not paid for it ; the democrats have .  what you are not talking about is you are passing deficit on to our kids .  you are passing debt on to our kids .  i visited with high schools and had town halls last weekend , and people said they are desperately concerned about the size of the nation 's deficit and the size of the nation 's debt .  the democratic package is paid for ; the republican package is not .  the democratic package does support small businesses and low-income folks and supports the middle class .  the republican package , the bulk of the economic benefits from these tax cuts go to the people who need it least at a time when we are fighting a war and trying to recover from a disaster .  i think that is a mistake .  we support tax cuts , but we would target them to the people who most need it ; and you target them to the people who most want it , but least need it .  that is the fundamental difference , and i think the american people see that difference .
