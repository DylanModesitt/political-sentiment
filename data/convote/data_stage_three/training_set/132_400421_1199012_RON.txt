mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman .  in the subcommittee bill in the area of fusion energy sciences , the subcommittee offered a very reasonable approach to funding fusion science , given the uncertainty surrounding the thermonuclear experimental reactor equipment .  as the subcommittee report notes : `` if the united states expects to be a serious contributor to international fusion research in general , and iter in particular , the nation needs to maintain strong domestic research programs and user facilities to train the next generation of fusion scientists and engineers. '' i think that is exactly right , and i want to commend the gentleman and subcommittee staff for putting that strong statement in our report .  mr. chairman , i want to highlight one area in particular that we fund and ask for the gentleman from ohio 's comments .  our bill provides $ 5.1 million for `` compact stellarators and small-scale experiments. '' i understand that to be a reference to experiments such as the quasi-polloidal stellarator , or qps , that is being developed by the oak ridge national laboratory .  mr. chairman , i ask the gentleman from ohio , is my understanding correct ?
