mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  mr. speaker , i do want to make one point about the resolution .  the statement toward the ends says : the president should direct the united states representative to the united nations to present and secure reports for the united nations security council classifying lebanon as a captive country in calling for the immediate release of lebanese detainees in syria and lebanon .  now that is pretty interesting that we are going to tell them who they can release and who they should release .  but the question i have , and maybe the sponsors of the resolution could answer this : will that include that we insist that they release the prisoners that we have sent to syria ?
