madam chairman , speaking further on the point of order , i would simply , calmly say to the gentleman that i very much agree , as the entire house agrees , that we must be responsive to the medical needs of our veterans , especially those who are coming back at this very moment .  there is not any doubt that the new military quality of life and veterans affairs , and related agencies subcommittee is designed in the fashion to be very responsive to the needs of veterans .  i urge the gentleman to recognize that we have begun hearings in connection with that already .  it is our intention in regular order to move these bills very quickly , and there is absolutely no doubt that the needs of these veterans , beyond money that is already in the pipeline , will be met as a result of regular order .
