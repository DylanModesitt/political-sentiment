i thank the chairman for yielding to me .  i think those examples really reflect the intent of the legislation .  madam speaker , the legislation also includes a local controversy exception which is intended to ensure that truly local class actions can remain in state court under the legislation .  under this provision , federal courts are instructed not to exercise jurisdiction over cases that meet all of the following four criteria : first , more than two-thirds of the class members must be the citizens of the state where the suit is brought ; second , there must be at least one in-state defendant from whom significant relief is sought by members of the class and whose conduct forms a significant basis of plaintiffs ' claims ; third , the principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or related conduct of each defendant must have occurred in the state where the action was originally filed ; and , fourth , no other class action has been filed during the preceding 3 years asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants .  madam speaker , i would ask that the chairman elaborate on these criteria .
