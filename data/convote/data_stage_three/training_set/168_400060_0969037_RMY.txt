mr. chairman , i rise today to express my strong support for h.r. 1279 , the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 .  i have spoken with sheriffs and police chiefs back in my district and they tell me : we need to be ready ; we need to learn how to confront these gangs .  this legislation will do just that , it will provide local , state , and federal law enforcement and legal authorities with personnel , equipment , and training needed to combat violent criminal gangs .  in virginia , no urban area has gone unscarred by criminal gangs .  across virginia , officials estimate that as many as 80 gangs totaling 30 , 000 members or more roam our city streets .  the commonwealth 's law enforcement and prosecutors will now have greater resources to combat violent criminal gang activity .  we must act now , if we are to protect virginia 's families and communities .  i urge passage of this legislation .
