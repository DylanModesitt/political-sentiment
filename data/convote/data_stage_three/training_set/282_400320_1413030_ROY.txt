mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time .  mr. speaker , billions of dollars in coverups , fraud investigations , abuses of power , calls for resignation , shredded documents .  i am not talking about the nixon or the clinton administrations , though both contained plenty of the above .  i am talking about the u.n. , that most sacred cow of international organizations .  it has been the subject of many scandals .  billions of dollars intended to help the iraqi people were stolen from the oil-for-food program .  it appears that that happened because of conflicts of interest at the highest levels of the u.n .  countries like syria , sudan , libya , north korea , china and cuba have had seats or still have seats on the human rights commission , the u.n. 's body for addressing human rights issues .  those nations are all members of the u.n. , and we should not kick them out , but they should not be setting policy on human rights .  members of this commission can veto certain resolutions that come before the u.n .  sudan , from its seats on the commission , has vetoed efforts to condemn the genocide it is committing in darfur .  u.n .  peacekeepers were recently found to be raping the children , the very people they were ordered to protect , in the congo .  we could go on and on .  the u.n .  plays a vital role in mediating disputes , in caring for the poor , and facilitating dialogue .  but the system seems to breed abuse and fraud and wasteful spending because of the u.n. 's huge bureaucracy .  it is accountable to no one .  much of what happens happens behind closed doors .  changes need to be made .  they need to be made in the structure of the u.n .  they need to be substantial , not cosmetic changes .  the mess needs to be cleaned up .  i urge support for the henry j. hyde u.n .  reform plan , which will make changes of substance .
