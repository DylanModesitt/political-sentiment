mr. speaker , if the gentleman would yield , the gentleman is correct , and we are all concerned about the higher gas prices and as important as that is to higher prices of oil and gas .  we have been trying to pass or get to the president an energy bill for almost 5 years or 6 years .  we have an excellent chance of actually getting a bill to the president this year .  we have had three committees scheduled to mark up components of the energy bill this week , the committee on energy and commerce , the committee on ways and means , and the committee on resources , but due to the shortened week , only one of those was able to begin their markup .  i hope , and we are going to work very hard , and i expect that all three of those committees will complete their markups next week , and we will be able to have a comprehensive energy bill on the floor hopefully by the following week .
