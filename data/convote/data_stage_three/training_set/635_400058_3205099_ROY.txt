mr. speaker , i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding .  i oppose the motion to recommit .  this motion to recommit leaves current pension funding rules in place which ends up weakening the funding rules in the underlying bill .  this means that businesses would not be fulfilling their promises to working people .  the motion to recommit also has a $ 53 billion surtax contained in it on small business .  that surtax is bad for workers , bad for small business , bad for america .  so i would urge a `` no '' vote on the motion to recommit , a `` yes '' vote on the underlying bill , which would ensure that pension plans would be appropriately funded , but not so strict as to cause employers to terminate their pension plans .  i urge a `` yes '' vote on the underlying bill .
