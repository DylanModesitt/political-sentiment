mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 418 .  the first thing is america will not sleep any more securely with the passage of this piece of legislation , as well intended as it may be , because i am not going to question the motives of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle .  but why do a useless thing ?  why would the state legislatures , why would the state governors , why would every latino advocacy group come against this ?  why would the national council of bishops here in the states come out against this ?  it is for various reasons .  but they all acknowledge that there is not a conspiracy going on here to thwart the efforts at security by these groups .  no one would accuse these individuals of that , because this does not do anything .  it only burdens the state and does not get us anywhere .  but more importantly , and i really believe this , this is an anti-immigrant bill in the guise of some sort of security consideration , which it does not further .  and so we ask , who are these immigrants ?  i have a simple answer for all of us .  look in the mirror .  that is who we are talking about .  we all got here one way or another , some earlier than others .  we are all immigrants .  what this bill is really about is not bad people coming into this country to do bad things to this country .  it is about preventing good people coming into this country to do good things .
