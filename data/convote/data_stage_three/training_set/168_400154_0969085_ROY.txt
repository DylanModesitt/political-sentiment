mr. chairman , i yield myself 30 seconds .  mr. chairman , the fact of the matter is that this has a great deterrent effect .  when the word gets out that they come back into this country and they get arrested after they have been deported and they are going to do serious time in the slammer , they are not as likely to come back .  and with the efforts that are ongoing with the real id act , we are going to keep a lot of these people out of the country with that method , and we are going to find them when they come into the country and try to get driver 's licenses .  but when they do , they need to know that they are going to face serious time .
