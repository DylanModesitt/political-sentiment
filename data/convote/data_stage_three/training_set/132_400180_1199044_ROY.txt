mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume .  let me close and say i want to thank my ranking member because we have worked together on this bill .  it is a very comprehensive and detailed bill in a lot of scientific ways .  we do take some visions for the future of this country which i think are very important when it comes to the waterways and we get the increased plume , which results from not finishing these projects , completed .  i think also as important , if not more so , is the vision for the corps and the waterways in the future .  also the vision for the department of energy both in the weapons area and in the area of future cost-effective power for this country so that this country can compete in the world in the future are both dealt with in various stages in this bill .  so i hope that everyone will support this bill .
