mr. speaker , i would hope on that bill , because of its great importance to the security of the nation and to all of our consumers of energy , which is to say all of us , that we would have as broad a consideration of it as possible so that we could get everybody 's ideas put on the floor , voted up or down , and move the bill with as big a consensus as we can accomplish .  mr. speaker , i thank the majority leader .
