mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h.j. res , 27 , a resolution withdrawing the u.s. approval of the wto .  while there are legitimate disagreements about how world trade is organized , and how trade agreements are negotiated , i think that it is important to have a forum and structure for international trade .  and that 's the world trade organization .  let 's not overlook the fact that in the 10 years since the wto 's inception , we 've seen global tariff rates fall and u.s. exports rise .  moreover , ninety-seven percent of our international trade is with other wto nations .  withdrawing from the wto would upset relations with these important partners and markets .  that being said , the wto is by no means a perfect institution .  it is important that we are having this debate today .  in the ongoing doha round of trade negotiations , the u.s. and our global partners have the opportunity to substantially improve the wto by reaching agreements on service negotiations , the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers , and the authority of the wto dispute resolution system .  we need to see these negotiations through to a satisfactory end .  nevertheless , despite its imperfections , the wto provides a stable and predictable global trading system that benefits the u.s. both economically and strategically .  and although i will be watching the doha round with keen interest , i support u.s. participation in the wto and therefore oppose this resolution .
