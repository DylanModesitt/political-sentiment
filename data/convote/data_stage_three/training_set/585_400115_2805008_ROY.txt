all three of those bills that i mentioned , the energy and water conference report and the science , state , justice , and commerce conference report , and military quality of life , they are all in conference as we speak .  it is our hope that those conferences will be completed and those conference reports will be filed in the house .  we can not anticipate exactly when their work will be completed .  we just want it to happen as expeditiously as possible .
